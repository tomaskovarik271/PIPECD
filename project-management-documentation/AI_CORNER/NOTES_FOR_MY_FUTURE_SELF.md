**Refactoring Session (Post-"Deal Assignment" Feature):**

**Key Backend Changes:**
*   `dealCrud.ts`: Improved type safety for deal probability calculations.
*   GraphQL `deal.ts` resolver for `Deal.weighted_amount`: Major refactor - now async, dynamically calculates based on `deal_specific_probability` or WFM step metadata (`outcome_type: "OPEN"` is crucial). Fixed RLS issues for `Deal.createdBy`/`assignedToUser` using `supabaseAdmin`.
*   GraphQL `dealMutations.ts`: Reviewed and refined permissions for `create/update/deleteDeal`.
*   WFM Step Metadata: Ensured "open" steps have `outcome_type: "OPEN"`.

**Key Frontend Changes:**
*   `useDealsStore.ts`: Introduced GraphQL fragments (e.g., `DEAL_CORE_FIELDS_FRAGMENT`). `updateDeal` action now returns `{ deal, error }` for better UI feedback.
*   `EditDealModal.tsx`: Updated to handle new `updateDeal` return, improved "Assign To" dropdown logic (permissions, `useMemo`).
*   `Sidebar.tsx`: Conditional rendering of "Custom Fields" based on permissions.
*   Kanban components: Optimized with `React.memo`.
*   General: `console.log` cleanup, `App.tsx` auth listener fix. Several "TODOs" remain.

**Overall:** Focused on type safety, permission consistency, dynamic data calculation (weighted amount), and frontend reactivity/UX for deal operations and assignments.

**Documentation Review & Update Session (Following WFM Admin UI Enhancements):**

*   **`README.md`**: Reviewed and found to be largely up-to-date with current project status, including WFM replacing pipelines/stages. No major changes needed.
*   **`DEVELOPER_GUIDE_V2.md`**:
    *   Updated project structure in Section 3 to remove `frontend/src/components/pipelines` and `frontend/src/components/stages`, and add `frontend/src/components/admin/wfm`.
    *   Updated references to reflect the WFM system as the primary process engine, replacing the old pipeline/stage system.
    *   Added a new **Section 6: Work Flow Management (WFM) System** detailing its concepts, integration with Sales Deals, and implementation specifics.
    *   Added a new **Section 11: Key Development Learnings & Best Practices** consolidating insights from recent feature developments.
    *   Corrected various outdated references and descriptions throughout the document to align with the WFM implementation.
    *   Verified that Section 10 (Code Generation) accurately reflects current backend GraphQL codegen practices.
*   **`project-management-documentation/adr/ADR.md` (Main ADR):**
    *   Updated "Revised" date.
    *   In Section 4.1 (Conceptual Service Decomposition):
        *   Deal Management: Marked as "✅ Done (Core CRUD, WFM-driven)".
        *   WFM Configuration: Marked as "✅ Done (Replaces legacy Pipeline/Stage Management. See ADR-006)".
        *   Contact Management: Marked as "✅ Done (Person/Org CRUD)".
*   **`project-management-documentation/ADR-006-WFM-as-Core-Process-Engine.md`:**
    *   Updated "Revised" date.
    *   Marked tasks related to WFM Admin UI for configuring sales-specific metadata (deal_probability, outcome_type) in `WFMWorkflowStep.metadata` as "DONE" in Section 4.1.8 / Sprint 1.3.
*   **`project-management-documentation/BACKLOG.md`:**
    *   Updated examples in STORE-001 (Refactor Store Error State Granularity) to reflect new WFM store names.
    *   Marked STAGE-002 (Implement UI and Backend for Stage Reordering within a Pipeline) as "Obsolete" (handled by WFM Admin UI).
    *   Marked ARCH-001 (Implement Pipeline and Stage Archiving Functionality) as "Obsolete" (handled by WFM Admin UI and `is_archived` flags).

**Outcome:** The core documentation files (`README.md`, `DEVELOPER_GUIDE_V2.md`, `ADR.md`, `ADR-006`, `BACKLOG.md`) are now more aligned with the current state of the project, especially regarding the WFM system.

**Remaining Refactoring Scope (As of last discussion):**

*   **Address Outstanding "TODO" Comments:**
    *   Prioritized areas from previous discussions include:
        *   Security/Permissions (various files).
        *   Form Validation Feedback (e.g., CreateDealModal for custom fields).
        *   Multi-select Custom Fields handling (frontend forms).
        *   WFM Core Logic enhancements (step deletions, reordering, transitions - as per ADR-006 and `wfmWorkflowService.ts` TODOs).
*   **Consolidate Create/Edit Deal Modal Logic:**
    *   Explore creating a shared `DealForm` component to reduce duplication between `CreateDealModal.tsx` and `EditDealModal.tsx`.
    *   Abstract common UI elements and form handling logic.
*   **Improve Error Handling Granularity in Zustand Stores (Task STORE-001 in `BACKLOG.md`):**
    *   Refactor stores like `useDealsStore`, `useWFMWorkflowStore`, etc., to have more specific error states (e.g., `fetchError`, `createError`, `updateError`) instead of a single generic error property per store slice.
    *   Update UI components to consume these granular error states for more targeted feedback.
*   **Review and Refine Frontend UI for WFM-driven Sales Process:**
    *   Ensure `DealDetailPage.tsx` correctly displays WFM status, probability, and provides intuitive actions for deal progression via WFM.
    *   Verify `EditDealModal.tsx` aligns with WFM progression (no direct stage editing).
    *   Update filtering/sorting in deal list views to use WFM-derived fields.
*   **General Code Quality & Cleanup:**
    *   Continue looking for opportunities to improve code clarity, remove unused code, and ensure consistency.
