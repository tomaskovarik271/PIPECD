# netlify/functions/graphql/schema/history.graphql

type DealHistoryEntry {
  id: ID!
  user: User # To be resolved to a User type
  eventType: String!
  changes: JSON # Represents the structured changes
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

# Extend User type if not already available for simple lookup by resolver
# If User type is complex, resolver might only return a subset like { id, name, email }
# Ensure base.graphql or similar defines/extends User appropriately.
# Example:
# type User {
#   id: ID!
#   email: String
#   # Add other fields like name, avatar_url if available and needed
# }
