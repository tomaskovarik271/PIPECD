# Codebase Takeover Report: Custom CRM System (Project PipeCD)

**Date:** 2024-07-27

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Goal:** Develop a custom CRM system to replace Pipedrive, focusing initially on an MVP feature set. Designed with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for future extensibility into adjacent business domains (Accounting, Logistics).
*   **Status (as per analysis):** Core MVP features (Contact & Deal CRUD, Authentication) are implemented and deployed. Backend services, GraphQL API, basic frontend UI, and foundational testing (unit, integration, E2E) are in place. Further testing, CI/CD integration, security hardening, and feature expansion are planned.
*   **Core Technologies:**
    *   **Frontend:** React (Vite), Chakra UI
    *   **API:** GraphQL (GraphQL Yoga)
    *   **Backend Logic:** TypeScript modules (`/lib`)
    *   **Serverless Platform:** Netlify (Functions, Hosting)
    *   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    *   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (JWT based - Email/Password, GitHub)
    *   **Async Tasks:** Inngest
    *   **Testing:** Vitest (Unit/Integration), Playwright (E2E)

## 2. Architecture

*   **High-Level:** Serverless architecture hosted on Netlify, leveraging Supabase for database and authentication, and Inngest for asynchronous tasks. A central GraphQL API gateway serves the React frontend.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Frontend SPA:** React/Vite application (`frontend/`) responsible for UI and user interaction.
    *   **GraphQL Gateway:** Netlify Function (`netlify/functions/graphql.ts`) using GraphQL Yoga. Acts as the single API endpoint for the frontend.
    *   **Backend Logic Modules:** TypeScript classes/functions (`lib/`) containing domain-specific business logic (e.g., `contactService`, `dealService`), invoked by the Gateway or Inngest handlers.
    *   **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL instance (`supabase/migrations/`) storing application data, secured by Row Level Security (RLS).
    *   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth handles user identity and JWT generation/verification.
    *   **Async Task Handler:** Netlify Function (`netlify/functions/inngest.ts`) serving Inngest event handlers.

## 3. Key Component Analysis

### 3.1. Backend (Netlify Functions & `/lib`)

*   **GraphQL Gateway (`graphql.ts`):**
    *   Uses GraphQL Yoga for performance in serverless environment.
    *   Defines schema for `Contact`, `Deal`, `User`, related inputs, and queries/mutations (CRUD for Contacts/Deals, `me`, health checks).
    *   Implements a context factory to verify Supabase JWT from `Authorization` header and inject `currentUser` into resolver context.
    *   Resolvers primarily delegate logic to services in `/lib`.
    *   Performs input validation using Zod schemas (`ContactInputSchema`, `DealInputSchema`) before calling services.
    *   Sends events (`crm/contact.created`, `crm/deal.created`) to Inngest after successful mutations.
    *   Configured error masking differentiates auth, validation, and internal errors.
*   **Service Layer (`contactService.ts`, `dealService.ts`):**
    *   Provides functions for CRUD operations (e.g., `getContacts`, `createDeal`).
    *   Uses a helper (`getAuthenticatedClient`) to create Supabase client instances *per request*, authenticated with the user's JWT. This is crucial for RLS enforcement.
    *   Relies heavily on Supabase RLS policies for authorization (filtering by `user_id`).
    *   Includes centralized Supabase error handling (`handleSupabaseError`).
    *   Logic is straightforward, mapping closely to database operations.
*   **Inngest Handler (`inngest.ts`):**
    *   Exports the Inngest client used by the Gateway.
    *   Defines Inngest functions (`logContactCreation`, `logDealCreation`) triggered by events.
    *   Current handlers only perform logging but are structured for adding future background processing steps.
    *   Includes placeholder Netlify handler, acknowledging that Inngest infra (Dev Server/Plugin) handles actual serving.

### 3.2. Database (Supabase)

*   **Schema (`supabase/migrations/`):**
    *   Defines `contacts` and `deals` tables with appropriate columns (UUIDs, timestamps, user\_id FK, contact\_id FK, data fields).
    *   `user_id` correctly references `auth.users` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
    *   `contact_id` on `deals` uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
    *   Includes indexes for common lookups (`user_id`, `contact_id`, `stage`).
    *   Uses a trigger (`trigger_set_timestamp`) to auto-update `updated_at` columns.
    *   Schema evolution is tracked via timestamped migration files (e.g., renaming `deals.value` to `deals.amount`).
*   **Security:**
    *   RLS is enabled on `contacts` and `deals`.
    *   Policies enforce that users can only SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE their own records (based on `auth.uid() = user_id`).

### 3.3. Frontend (React/Vite)

*   **GraphQL Client (`frontend/src/lib/graphqlClient.ts`):**
    *   Uses `graphql-request`.
    *   Correctly determines the API endpoint URL for local dev (`netlify dev`) vs. production.
    *   Implements `requestMiddleware` to automatically fetch the current Supabase session and inject the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header before each request.
*   **Pages (`DealsPage.tsx`, `ContactsPage.tsx`):**
    *   Follow standard React patterns using hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`).
    *   Define GraphQL queries/mutations and corresponding TypeScript interfaces.
    *   Use the `gqlClient` to fetch data and execute mutations.
    *   Handle loading and error states during data fetching and mutation operations.
    *   Render data using Chakra UI components (`Table`, `List`, `Spinner`, `Alert`).
    *   Integrate with modal/form components (`CreateDealModal`, `EditDealModal`, `CreateContactForm`, etc.) for CRUD actions, passing callbacks for success/closure.
*   **Forms/Modals (`CreateContactForm.tsx` example):**
    *   Encapsulate form state and logic within the component.
    *   Perform basic client-side validation for immediate feedback (primary validation is server-side).
    *   Call the appropriate GraphQL mutation via `gqlClient`.
    *   Provide user feedback using Chakra UI `useToast`.
    *   Communicate results back to parent page via `onSuccess` / `onClose` callbacks.

## 4. Development & Deployment

*   **Local Setup:** Uses `netlify dev` to run the frontend dev server and serve Netlify functions locally. Requires Docker for local Supabase (`supabase start`). Environment variables managed via `.env` files (root and `frontend/`). Database schema managed via `supabase db reset`. Detailed instructions in `README.md` and `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`.
*   **Deployment:** Automated via Netlify connecting to the `main` branch. Builds the frontend (`cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`) and deploys functions. Requires specific `SUPABASE_*`, `INNGEST_*`, and `VITE_SUPABASE_*` environment variables set in the Netlify UI for production. **Critical:** Supabase database migrations must be applied manually to production using the Supabase CLI (`supabase migration up --linked`).

## 5. Testing

*   **Strategy:** Prioritized approach focusing on unit/integration tests for backend logic/resolvers/handlers (Vitest) and core E2E flows (Playwright) for the MVP. Test coverage expansion planned post-MVP.
*   **Backend (Vitest - `vitest.config.ts`, `lib/dealService.test.ts`):**
    *   Configured to run tests in Node environment from `/lib` and `/netlify/functions`.
    *   Uses `vi.mock` to effectively mock the `@supabase/supabase-js` client, allowing isolated testing of service logic.
    *   Tests cover happy paths and error handling scenarios for service methods.
*   **Frontend (Vitest/RTL - `frontend/vite.config.ts` mentioned):** Configuration exists, basic component tests implemented (`DealsPage.test.tsx`). Further component test coverage is needed (Roadmap).
*   **E2E (Playwright - `playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/auth.spec.ts`):**
    *   Configured to use Chromium by default.
    *   Uses the `webServer` option to automatically start `netlify dev` before running tests.
    *   Basic authentication flow (successful login) is implemented, assuming a pre-existing test user. Further E2E tests planned (Roadmap).

## 6. Key Risks & Considerations (from ADR)

*   **GraphQL Gateway Cold Starts:** Mitigated by using lightweight GraphQL Yoga. Monitor latency and consider optimizations/provisioned concurrency if needed.
*   **Serverless Limits:** Be mindful of Netlify Function limits (time, memory). Offload long tasks to Inngest.
*   **GraphQL Security:** Requires implementation of query depth/complexity limits and disabling introspection in production (Roadmap). Input validation via Zod is already in place.
*   **Inngest Lock-in/Cost:** Dependency on SaaS. Mitigations: Monitor cost, abstract client calls, schedule re-evaluation of alternatives.
*   **Compliance (GDPR):** Data erasure workflow needs implementation and testing via Inngest. RLS/Auth are foundations.
*   **Testing Complexity:** Requires ongoing effort. Current strategy prioritizes MVP. Coverage needs expansion.

## 7. Roadmap Summary

*   **Phases 0 & 1 (Foundation & Core Arch):** Mostly complete.
*   **Phase 2 (MVP Features - Contacts/Deals):** Largely complete (CRUD backend/frontend, basic Inngest logging).
*   **Phase 3 (Testing & Deployment):** In progress. Foundational testing setup done. Writing tests, CI integration, security hardening, monitoring are key remaining tasks. Production deployment is live but requires ongoing manual migrations.
*   **Phase 4 (Future):** Post-MVP feature parity, test coverage expansion, performance optimization, compliance workflows, potential refactoring, new domains.

## 8. Overall Assessment & Next Steps

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Clear, modern architecture based on serverless principles (Netlify, Supabase).
    *   Good separation of concerns (Frontend, Gateway, Logic, DB).
    *   Leverages Supabase RLS effectively for security.
    *   Uses TypeScript throughout for better maintainability.
    *   Asynchronous tasks decoupled via Inngest.
    *   Solid foundation for testing (Vitest, Playwright configured).
    *   Good documentation (README, DEV GUIDE, ADR, ROADMAP).
*   **Areas for Attention/Improvement:**
    *   **Testing:** Expand unit/integration test coverage (frontend components, backend logic edge cases) and E2E test scope (signup, CRUD flows). Integrate tests into CI pipeline.
    *   **Security:** Implement planned GraphQL security measures (depth/complexity limits, disable introspection). Regularly review RLS policies.
    *   **Inngest Handlers:** Implement actual business logic beyond logging (e.g., notifications, data processing, compliance workflows). Address auth within Inngest functions if needed.
    *   **Error Handling:** Frontend error display could be more granular in some cases (e.g., distinguishing specific validation errors vs. general failures).
    *   **Database Migrations:** The manual production migration process is a potential point of failure; investigate strategies to mitigate risk (e.g., staging environment, stricter review process).
    *   **Feature Completeness:** Address remaining MVP items and plan post-MVP feature development according to the roadmap.
*   **Suggested Immediate Next Steps:**
    1.  **Enhance Testing:** Add more E2E tests for core CRUD flows (Contacts, Deals) and integrate backend/frontend test runs into the CI pipeline (e.g., via GitHub Actions if applicable, or Netlify build hooks).
    2.  **Security Hardening:** Implement GraphQL query depth/complexity limits and disable introspection in production within `netlify/functions/graphql.ts`.
    3.  **Review Roadmap:** Verify completion of Phase 3 items and prioritize tasks for moving towards Phase 4.
    4.  **(Optional)** Refactor shared helpers (e.g., `getAuthenticatedClient`, `handleSupabaseError`) from services into a common utility module within `/lib`.
