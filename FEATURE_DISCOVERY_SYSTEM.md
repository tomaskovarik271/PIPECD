# PipeCD Feature Discovery System

## Overview

PipeCD's Feature Discovery System provides intelligent, contextual guidance for innovative CRM features that break traditional patterns. The system helps users discover and understand unique capabilities without overwhelming experienced users.

## Design Principles

### 1. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Start with subtle hints, escalate to detailed guidance only when needed
- Allow users to control their learning experience
- Remember user preferences and progress

### 2. **Contextual Relevance**
- Show guidance when and where it's most useful
- Adapt to user behavior and current workflow
- Prioritize features based on user role and usage patterns

### 3. **Non-Intrusive Design**
- Maintain PipeCD's clean, professional interface
- Provide opt-out mechanisms for all guidance
- Use subtle visual cues that enhance rather than distract

### 4. **Intelligent Persistence**
- Track which features users have discovered and used
- Adapt guidance frequency based on user expertise
- Sync discovery state across sessions

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FeatureDiscoveryService** - Central service managing feature hints and user progress
2. **FeatureTooltip** - Reusable component for contextual tooltips
3. **FeatureCallout** - Component for more prominent feature announcements
4. **FeatureSpotlight** - Full-screen overlay for major feature introductions
5. **FeatureDiscoveryProvider** - React context for system-wide state management

### Data Models

```typescript
interface FeatureHint {
  id: string;                    // Unique feature identifier
  title: string;                 // Feature name
  description: string;           // Brief explanation
  detailedDescription?: string;  // Extended explanation
  context: string[];             // Pages/components where it appears
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  type: 'tooltip' | 'callout' | 'spotlight' | 'badge';
  category: 'innovative' | 'standard' | 'advanced';
  prerequisites?: string[];      // Other features user should know first
  demoUrl?: string;             // Link to demo video/gif
  docsUrl?: string;             // Link to documentation
}

interface UserDiscoveryState {
  discoveredFeatures: Set<string>;
  dismissedFeatures: Set<string>;
  featureUsageCount: Map<string, number>;
  lastSeenVersion: string;
  discoveryPreferences: {
    showTooltips: boolean;
    showCallouts: boolean;
    showSpotlights: boolean;
    autoAdvance: boolean;
  };
}
```
