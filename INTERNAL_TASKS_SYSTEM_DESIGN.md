# Internal Tasks System Design & Implementation

## üéØ **Core Philosophy**

PipeCD's internal task system is designed to be **CRM-native**, where every task has business context and drives deal progression. Unlike generic to-do apps, our tasks are business intelligence in action form.

### **Key Principles:**
- **Business Context First** - Every task knows its business purpose
- **Timeline Integration** - Tasks appear alongside calendar events
- **Smart Automation** - System suggests logical next actions
- **CRM-Native** - Tasks directly tied to deals, leads, people, organizations

## üõ§Ô∏è **User Journeys**

### **Journey 1: Sales Rep Daily Workflow**
```
üåÖ Morning Routine:
1. Opens PipeCD ‚Üí sees dashboard with today's tasks + meetings
2. Timeline shows: "9 AM - Call ORVIL" (task) + "2 PM - Demo with Bank of Austria" (calendar)
3. Clicks task ‚Üí sees context: "Follow up on ‚Ç¨90K proposal sent last week"
4. Makes call ‚Üí marks task complete ‚Üí auto-creates "Send contract" task
5. Adds quick note: "CEO interested, wants to discuss pricing"

üìä Throughout Day:
‚Ä¢ Timeline keeps them on track with mixed tasks/meetings
‚Ä¢ Completes tasks with one click
‚Ä¢ Creates new tasks: "Research competitor pricing for ORVIL"
‚Ä¢ AI suggests: "Deal inactive for 5 days - create follow-up task?"
```

### **Journey 2: Deal Progression Workflow**
```
üíº Active Deal Management:
1. User updates deal stage: "Proposal" ‚Üí "Contract Review"
2. System auto-creates task: "Follow up on contract feedback by Friday"
3. User sees task in deal timeline alongside previous meetings
4. Task due date auto-calculated from deal close date
5. User completes task ‚Üí system suggests: "Schedule contract signing meeting?"

üîÑ Continuous Context:
‚Ä¢ Each task shows full deal context (value, contacts, stage)
‚Ä¢ Task completion triggers next logical business action
‚Ä¢ Timeline shows complete deal story: meetings + tasks + outcomes
```

### **Journey 3: Email-to-Action Workflow**
```
üìß Email Processing:
1. User receives important email in deal context
2. Clicks "Create Task from Email" (enhanced existing feature)
3. AI suggests task: "Respond to pricing questions from ORVIL CEO"
4. Task auto-links to email thread + deal + contact
5. Due date suggested based on email urgency + deal timeline

‚úÖ Task Completion:
‚Ä¢ User completes task directly from email panel
‚Ä¢ Task notes auto-populate from email response
‚Ä¢ System tracks email‚Üítask‚Üíoutcome chain
```

### **Journey 4: Team Collaboration**
```
üë• Task Assignment:
1. Deal owner assigns task: "Prepare technical demo for Bank of Slovakia"
2. Task assigned to technical team member
3. Assignee sees task in their timeline with full deal context
4. Completes task ‚Üí uploads demo materials to deal documents
5. Deal owner gets notification: "Demo materials ready"

üîÑ Handoff Management:
‚Ä¢ Tasks bridge between team members
‚Ä¢ Context never lost during handoffs
‚Ä¢ Timeline shows who did what when
```

### **Journey 5: AI-Powered Task Management**
```
ü§ñ Smart Suggestions:
1. User asks AI: "What should I focus on today?"
2. AI analyzes deals + creates prioritized task list
3. "High priority: Follow up with ORVIL (‚Ç¨90K deal, 3 days since last contact)"
4. User accepts suggestion ‚Üí task created with context
5. AI monitors progress ‚Üí suggests next actions

üí° Proactive Automation:
‚Ä¢ "Deal closing in 2 weeks, no recent activity - create reminder task?"
‚Ä¢ "Contract sent 5 days ago - create follow-up task?"
‚Ä¢ "Meeting completed - create summary task?"
```

### **Journey 6: Pipeline Review Workflow**
```
üìà Weekly Pipeline Review:
1. Manager opens pipeline view
2. Sees deals with overdue tasks highlighted
3. Clicks deal ‚Üí timeline shows task bottlenecks
4. Creates team tasks: "All hands: Update Q4 forecasts"
5. Assigns bulk tasks across multiple deals

üéØ Performance Tracking:
‚Ä¢ Task completion rates by deal stage
‚Ä¢ Time from task creation to completion
‚Ä¢ Task types that correlate with closed deals
```

### **Journey 7: Mobile/Quick Actions**
```
üì± On-the-Go Productivity:
1. User gets notification: "Task due in 1 hour: Call ORVIL"
2. Clicks notification ‚Üí opens deal context
3. Makes call using phone integration
4. Quick update: "Left voicemail, CEO in meetings"
5. Reschedules task: "Follow up tomorrow 2 PM"

‚ö° Rapid Task Creation:
‚Ä¢ Voice note ‚Üí AI creates task with context
‚Ä¢ Photo of business card ‚Üí creates follow-up task
‚Ä¢ Quick capture without losing business context
```

### **Journey 8: Meeting-to-Task Workflow**
```
ü§ù Post-Meeting Action Items:
1. Meeting ends in Google Calendar
2. User opens deal timeline ‚Üí sees completed meeting
3. Clicks "Add Action Items" 
4. Creates multiple tasks from meeting outcomes:
   ‚Ä¢ "Send pricing proposal by Wednesday"
   ‚Ä¢ "Schedule technical demo next week"
   ‚Ä¢ "Research enterprise pricing options"
5. Tasks auto-inherit meeting context + attendees

üìù Meeting Documentation:
‚Ä¢ Tasks become the "action trail" from meetings
‚Ä¢ Easy to see what was promised and when
‚Ä¢ Follow-up meetings reference previous action items
```

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

Let's begin with **Phase 1.1: Database Setup** and create the foundation for our internal task system. The implementation will follow PipeCD's established patterns while introducing powerful new capabilities for business task management.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create tasks table migration
2. Set up basic task service
3. Build core UI components
4. Integrate with existing timeline

This system will transform how users manage business actions, making PipeCD the single source of truth for both relationship data AND the tasks that drive those relationships forward! üé™
