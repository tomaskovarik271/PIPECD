# PipeCD Business Rules Engine - Administrator Manual

## üéØ Overview

The Business Rules Engine is PipeCD's powerful automation system that monitors your CRM data and automatically triggers actions when specific conditions are met. Think of it as your digital assistant that never sleeps - watching for important events and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Understanding Rule Types

**EVENT_BASED Rules** - Trigger when something happens:
- ‚úÖ Deal created, updated, or assigned
- ‚úÖ Lead converted or status changed
- üîÑ Person/Organization updated (coming soon)

**FIELD_CHANGE Rules** - Trigger when specific fields change:
- ‚úÖ Deal amount increases/decreases
- ‚úÖ Assignment changes
- ‚úÖ Status or stage transitions

**TIME_BASED Rules** - Trigger on schedule:
- üîÑ Daily, weekly, or monthly checks (coming soon)
- üîÑ Stale deal alerts
- üîÑ Follow-up reminders

### Step 2: Your First Rule

1. Click **"Create Business Rule"**
2. Choose **"High Value Deal Alert"** template
3. Set conditions: `amount > 50000`
4. Set action: `NOTIFY_OWNER`
5. Write message: `"High value deal detected: {{deal_name}} - Amount: {{deal_amount}}"`
6. Click **"Save & Activate"**

üéâ **Congratulations!** Your rule will now automatically notify deal owners when high-value deals are created.

## üèóÔ∏è Rule Components Deep Dive

### Rule Information

```

### Conditions System

Build sophisticated conditions using these operators:

**Comparison Operators**:

### Actions System

**NOTIFY_USER** ‚úÖ - Send notification to specific user
```json
{
  "type": "NOTIFY_USER",

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Condition Rules

**AND Logic** - All conditions must be true:
```json
[
  {"field": "amount", "operator": "GREATER_THAN", "value": 50000, "logicalOperator": "AND"},
  {"field": "close_date", "operator": "NEWER_THAN", "value": "30 days"}
]
```

**OR Logic** - Any condition can be true:
```json
[
  {"field": "status", "operator": "EQUALS", "value": "URGENT", "logicalOperator": "OR"},
  {"field": "amount", "operator": "GREATER_THAN", "value": 100000}
]
```

### Complex Conditions

**Date-Based Conditions**:
```json
{"field": "close_date", "operator": "OLDER_THAN", "value": "7 days"}
{"field": "created_at", "operator": "NEWER_THAN", "value": "1 hour"}
```

**Percentage Change Detection**:
```json
{"field": "amount", "operator": "INCREASED_BY_PERCENT", "value": 50}
{"field": "amount", "operator": "DECREASED_BY_PERCENT", "value": 25}
```

**List Matching**:
```json
{"field": "status", "operator": "IN", "value": ["ACTIVE", "NEGOTIATION", "PROPOSAL"]}
{"field": "source", "operator": "NOT_IN", "value": ["SPAM", "INVALID"]}
```

### Priority and Notification Management

**Priority Guidelines**:
- **Priority 1 (Low)**: Informational updates, routine notifications
- **Priority 2 (Medium)**: Standard business alerts, assignment changes
- **Priority 3 (High)**: Important issues requiring attention
- **Priority 4 (Urgent)**: Critical problems needing immediate action

**Notification Best Practices**:
- Use clear, action-oriented messages
- Include relevant context with template variables
- Set appropriate priorities to avoid alert fatigue
- Test rules before activating in production

## üß™ Testing & Debugging

### Rule Testing

**Test Mode**: Use the "Test Rule" button to validate rules without triggering real notifications

**Manual Execution**: 
```graphql
mutation {
  executeBusinessRule(
    ruleId: "your-rule-uuid"
    entityType: DEAL
    entityId: "test-deal-uuid"
    testMode: true
  ) {
    rulesProcessed
    notificationsCreated
    errors
  }
}
```

### Debugging Tools

**Rule Executions Tab**: Monitor rule performance and identify issues
- Execution count and success rate
- Error messages and stack traces
- Performance metrics and timing

**Notification Center**: Verify notifications are created and properly formatted
- Check template variable substitution
- Confirm priority levels and targeting
- Review notification history

### Common Issues

**Rule Not Triggering**:
1. ‚úÖ Check rule status (must be ACTIVE)
2. ‚úÖ Verify trigger events match your test scenario
3. ‚úÖ Confirm conditions are correctly configured
4. ‚úÖ Check entity type matches your test data

**Template Variables Not Working**:
1. ‚úÖ Verify variable names are correct (case-sensitive)
2. ‚úÖ Check entity data contains the referenced fields
3. ‚úÖ Ensure template syntax uses double braces `{{variable}}`

**Performance Issues**:
1. ‚úÖ Review condition complexity
2. ‚úÖ Check rule execution frequency
3. ‚úÖ Monitor database performance impact

**Consistent Formatting**: Use standardized message templates

### Performance Optimization

**Efficient Conditions**: Use specific conditions to minimize rule execution

**Batch Operations**: Group related rules to reduce system load

**Archive Inactive Rules**: Remove or disable unused rules

**Monitor Execution Frequency**: Watch for rules triggering too often

## üÜò Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Problems

**"Rule not triggering"**:
- Verify rule status is ACTIVE
- Check trigger configuration matches test scenario
- Confirm entity type and conditions are correct
- Review rule execution logs for errors

**"Template variables showing as {{variable}}"**:
- Check variable name spelling and case
- Verify entity data contains the referenced field
- Ensure proper template syntax with double braces
