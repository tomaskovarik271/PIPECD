## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Database Layer**
```sql
-- New column added to organizations table
ALTER TABLE organizations ADD COLUMN account_manager_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);

-- New permissions added to RBAC
INSERT INTO permissions (name, description) VALUES 
  ('organization:assign_account_manager', 'Can assign account managers to organizations'),
  ('organization:manage_own_accounts', 'Can manage organizations assigned as account manager'),
  ('organization:view_account_portfolio', 'Can view account manager portfolio');
```

### **GraphQL Schema**
```graphql
type Organization {
  account_manager_id: ID
  accountManager: UserProfile
  totalDealValue: Float
  activeDealCount: Int
  lastActivity: Activity
}

type Query {
  myAccounts: [Organization!]!
  myAccountPortfolioStats: AccountPortfolioStats!
}

type Mutation {
  assignAccountManager(organizationId: ID!, userId: ID!): Organization!
  removeAccountManager(organizationId: ID!): Organization!
}
```

### **Frontend Components**
- **`MyAccountsPage.tsx`**: Portfolio dashboard with statistics and account management
- **`AccountManagerAssignmentModal.tsx`**: Admin tool for account manager assignment
- **Enhanced `CreateOrganizationModal.tsx`**: Account manager selection during creation
- **Enhanced `EditOrganizationModal.tsx`**: Account manager modification
- **`accountOperations.ts`**: Complete GraphQL operations library

## üé® **User Experience Features**

### **For Account Managers**
1. **Portfolio Dashboard**: Beautiful cards showing assigned organizations
2. **Statistics Overview**: Total accounts, pipeline value, active deals, attention needed
3. **Activity Tracking**: Color-coded activity indicators (green=recent, yellow=moderate, red=stale)
4. **Quick Navigation**: Click any account card to view organization details
5. **Empty State**: Helpful guidance when no accounts are assigned

### **For Admins**
1. **Assignment During Creation**: Select account manager when creating organizations
2. **Bulk Assignment Tool**: Dedicated modal for assigning/removing account managers
3. **Visual Feedback**: Current assignments clearly displayed with user avatars
4. **Permission-Based Access**: Only users with appropriate permissions see account management features

### **For All Users**

2. **Permission-Aware Navigation**: "My Accounts" only appears for users with portfolio permissions
3. **Consistent UI**: All components follow PipeCD's theme system and design patterns

## üîê **Security & Permissions**

### **Permission Matrix**
| Action | Required Permission | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| View My Accounts | `organization:view_account_portfolio` | Access portfolio dashboard |
| Assign Account Manager | `organization:assign_account_manager` | Admin assignment capabilities |
| Manage Own Accounts | `organization:manage_own_accounts` | Enhanced access to assigned orgs |

### **Data Security**
- **RLS Policies**: Account managers can only see their assigned organizations
- **GraphQL Filtering**: `myAccounts` query automatically filters by user assignment
- **Permission Validation**: All mutations validate user permissions before execution

---

## üìä **Portfolio Statistics**

The system provides real-time statistics for account managers:

1. **Total Accounts**: Count of assigned organizations
2. **Pipeline Value**: Sum of active deal values across all accounts
3. **Active Deals**: Count of deals in progress
4. **Attention Needed**: Organizations with no recent activity (configurable threshold)

---

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **Account Manager Workflow**
```
1. User logs in ‚Üí Sees "My Accounts" in sidebar (if has permission)
2. Clicks "My Accounts" ‚Üí Views portfolio dashboard
3. Sees statistics: accounts, pipeline value, active deals, attention needed
4. Views account cards with activity indicators
5. Clicks account ‚Üí Navigates to organization detail page
```

### **Admin Assignment Workflow**
```
1. Admin creates/edits organization ‚Üí Sees account manager dropdown
2. Selects user from list ‚Üí Organization gets assigned
3. OR uses AccountManagerAssignmentModal for bulk operations
4. Account manager gets notified (future: notification system)
5. Assignment visible in organization details and account manager portfolio
```

### **Deal Creation Integration**
```
1. User creates deal ‚Üí Selects organization
2. If organization has account manager ‚Üí Auto-suggests for deal assignment
3. Account manager sees deal in their portfolio statistics
4. Activity tracking updates across account management system
```
