# Manual Testing Guide: Bi-Directional Lead-Deal Conversion System

## üéØ Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Conversion tables created successfully
- ‚úÖ **GraphQL**: Endpoint responding with conversion types available  
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Components**: All conversion components exist and build successfully
- ‚úÖ **UI Integration**: Conversion button added to leads table
- ‚úÖ **Modal Integration**: ConvertLeadModal properly integrated with required props

## üöÄ **Testing the Conversion Button**

The conversion button should now be visible in the leads table! Here's how to test it:

### Step 1: Access the Leads Page
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5174/leads` (assuming netlify dev is running)
2. Make sure you're in **Table view** (not Kanban view)
3. Look at the **Actions column** in the leads table

### Step 2: Find the Conversion Button
In the Actions column, you should see these buttons for each lead:
- üëÅÔ∏è **View** (eye icon) - View lead details
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Convert to Deal** (green arrow icon) ‚Üê **THIS IS THE NEW BUTTON!**
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit** (pencil icon) - Edit lead
- üóëÔ∏è **Delete** (trash icon) - Delete lead

### Step 3: Test the Conversion Modal
1. Click the **green arrow (‚û°Ô∏è) button** next to any lead
2. The **ConvertLeadModal** should open with:
   - Lead information pre-filled
   - Deal creation form
   - Person and organization data
   - Conversion options
   - Preview section

### Step 4: Test Modal Functionality
1. **Form should be pre-populated** with lead data
2. **Validation should work** (check for required fields)
3. **Preview should update** as you change form values
4. **Close button should work** without errors
5. **Console should show** "Conversion completed" when you attempt conversion (it's still a mock)

## üîß **Technical Implementation Complete**

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
1. **Conversion button** appears in leads table actions column
2. **Modal opens** when button is clicked
3. **Form is pre-populated** with lead data
4. **TypeScript compilation** passes successfully
5. **Frontend build** completes without errors
6. **All imports and components** properly connected

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What's Still Mock/TODO:**
1. **Actual conversion logic** - currently shows success toast but doesn't create real deals
2. **GraphQL mutation** - needs to be connected to real backend conversion
3. **Error handling** - full error scenarios not implemented
4. **Data validation** - some validation is mocked

## üéâ **Success Indicators**

### ‚úÖ **You should see:**
1. **Green arrow button** in leads table actions column
2. **Modal opens** smoothly when button clicked
3. **No console errors** in browser developer tools
4. **Form fields populated** with lead data
5. **Success toast** appears when you click convert (even though it's mock)

### ‚ùå **If you don't see the button:**
1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify you're in table view** (not kanban view)
3. **Refresh the page** to ensure latest code is loaded
4. **Check netlify dev** is running and up to date

## üöÄ **Next Steps for Full Implementation**

To complete the conversion system:

1. **Connect GraphQL Mutation**: Replace mock conversion with real `convertLead` mutation
2. **Add Error Handling**: Implement proper error states and user feedback
3. **Test with Real Data**: Verify conversion creates actual deals in database
4. **Add Conversion History**: Track conversion events in database
5. **Implement Reverse Conversion**: Add deal-to-lead conversion functionality

## üí° **Development Notes**

The conversion button integration is now **100% complete** from a UI perspective:
- ‚úÖ Button appears in correct location
- ‚úÖ Modal opens with proper props
- ‚úÖ All TypeScript types are correct
- ‚úÖ Build system working
- ‚úÖ Component architecture follows established patterns

The system is ready for backend integration - the frontend UI layer is fully functional and waiting for the GraphQL conversion mutation to be connected to real business logic.

## üéØ **Quick Test Command**

To quickly verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. Start the development server
netlify dev

# 2. Open browser to leads page
# http://localhost:5174/leads

# 3. Look for green arrow button in table actions column
# 4. Click it and verify modal opens
```

**Status: UI Integration Complete ‚úÖ**

## üåê **Frontend Testing Steps**

### Step 1: Access the Application
```bash
# Open your browser to:
http://localhost:5174
```

### Step 2: Log In
- Use your existing PipeCD credentials
- Navigate through the authenticated interface

### Step 3: Check for Conversion UI Elements

#### 3.1 Navigate to Leads Page
1. Go to **Leads page** (`/leads`)
2. Switch to **Table view** if you're in Kanban view
3. Look for the actions column in the table

#### 3.2 Expected UI Elements
Look for these elements in the leads table:
- üëÅÔ∏è **View button** (eye icon)
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Convert to Deal button** (green arrow icon) ‚Üê **THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TESTING**
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit button** (pencil icon)  
- üóëÔ∏è **Delete button** (trash icon)

### Step 4: Test Conversion Functionality

#### 4.1 If Conversion Button Exists:
1. Click the **green arrow (‚û°Ô∏è) button** next to a lead
2. **ConvertLeadModal should open** with:
   - Lead information pre-filled
   - Deal creation form
   - Conversion options
   - Preview section

#### 4.2 If Conversion Button Missing:
The button integration needs to be completed. The components exist but need to be connected.

## üîß **Component Status Check**

### Verify Components Exist:
```bash
# Check if conversion components exist:
ls frontend/src/components/conversion/
```

**Expected files:**
- ‚úÖ `ConvertLeadModal.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `ConvertDealModal.tsx` 
- ‚úÖ `BulkConvertLeadsModal.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `ConversionHistoryPanel.tsx`

### Verify GraphQL Integration:
```bash
# Test GraphQL conversion types:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "query { __schema { types { name } } }"}'
```

Look for conversion-related types in the response.

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: No Conversion Button in Table
**Cause**: UI integration not complete
**Solution**: The `handleConvertClick` parameter needs to be added to `useLeadsTableColumns`

### Issue: GraphQL Errors
**Cause**: Schema conflicts or missing resolvers
**Solution**: Check netlify dev logs for GraphQL function errors

### Issue: Modal Not Opening
**Cause**: Component import or state management issue
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## üìä **Expected Test Results**

### ‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
1. **Conversion button appears** in leads table actions
2. **Modal opens** when conversion button clicked
3. **Form is pre-populated** with lead data
4. **No console errors** in browser developer tools
5. **GraphQL types available** in schema

### ‚ùå **Failure Indicators:**
1. **No conversion button** in table
2. **Console errors** about missing components
3. **Modal fails to open** 
4. **GraphQL schema missing** conversion types

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

If conversion buttons are missing:
1. **Complete UI integration** by adding `handleConvertClick` to table columns
2. **Add ConvertLeadModal** to the modals section of LeadsPage
3. **Test the complete workflow** from button click to deal creation

If everything works:
1. **Test lead-to-deal conversion** with real data
2. **Verify deal creation** in deals page
3. **Check conversion history** in database
4. **Test error handling** with invalid data

## üí° **Quick Integration Fix**

If you want to quickly add the conversion button, you need to:

1. **Update** `frontend/src/hooks/useLeadsTableColumns.tsx` to include `handleConvertClick`
2. **Update** `frontend/src/pages/LeadsPage.tsx` to pass the conversion handler
3. **Add** `<ConvertLeadModal>` to the modals section

The components are ready - they just need to be connected!
