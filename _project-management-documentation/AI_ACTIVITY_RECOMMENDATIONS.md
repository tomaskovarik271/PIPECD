# ü§ñ AI-Powered Activity Recommendations

## Overview

The AI Activity Recommendations feature uses Claude 3.5 Haiku to analyze deal context and suggest the most effective next sales activities. This intelligent system considers deal stage, timeline, value, contact information, and recent activity patterns to provide personalized, actionable recommendations.

## Features

### üß† Intelligent Analysis
- **Deal Context Analysis**: Examines deal value, stage, timeline, and probability
- **Contact Intelligence**: Considers person and organization information
- **Activity Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes recent activities to avoid duplication
- **Urgency Detection**: Identifies overdue activities and approaching deadlines

### üéØ Smart Recommendations
- **Prioritized Activities**: Returns 3 activities ranked by effectiveness
- **Activity Types**: CALL, EMAIL, MEETING, TASK, DEADLINE
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each recommendation includes a confidence level (0-1)
- **Contextual Reasoning**: Explains why each activity is recommended
- **Smart Due Dates**: Suggests appropriate timing for each activity

### üîÑ Fallback System
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to smart defaults if AI is unavailable
- **Rule-Based Logic**: Uses deal context to generate sensible recommendations
- **No Service Interruption**: Always provides recommendations regardless of API status

- **people**: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`
- **organizations**: `name`
- **activities**: `type`, `subject`, `created_at`, `is_done`, `due_date`

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter "column does not exist" errors:
1. Verify your database schema matches the expected columns above
2. Check if column names use different naming conventions (e.g., `job_title` vs `jobTitle`)
3. The system gracefully handles missing optional fields like `job_title` and `industry`

### Security
