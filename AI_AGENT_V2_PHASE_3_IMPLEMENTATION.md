## üöÄ **Development Plan Status**

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ Phase 1 | Complete | Basic V2 Infrastructure |
| ‚úÖ Phase 2 | Complete | Claude Sonnet 4 Integration |
| ‚úÖ **Phase 3** | **Complete** | **Think Tool Implementation** |
| üîÑ Phase 4 | Next | CRM Tool Integration |
| ‚è≥ Phase 5 | Planned | Advanced Analytics |
| ‚è≥ Phase 6 | Planned | Workflow Automation |

## üìù **Usage Examples**

### **Complex Business Analysis**
```
User: "How can we optimize our sales pipeline conversion rates?"

Claude: *Uses think tool to analyze*
üí≠ Think Tool Analysis
üéØ Question Analysis: The user is asking about optimizing sales pipeline conversion rates
Strategy: Multi-factor analysis of conversion bottlenecks
Concerns: Need access to actual pipeline data for specific recommendations
Next Steps: 1. Analyze current metrics, 2. Identify bottlenecks, 3. Recommend solutions
```

### **Strategic Planning**
```
User: "Should we expand to the European market?"

Claude: *Deep think tool analysis*
üí≠ Think Tool Analysis
üéØ Question Analysis: The user is asking about European market expansion strategy and feasibility
Reasoning: Market expansion requires careful analysis of resources, competition, and opportunity
Strategy: Risk-benefit framework with market research and resource planning
Concerns: Regulatory complexity and resource allocation challenges
Next Steps: 1. Market research, 2. Competitive analysis, 3. Resource planning, 4. Risk assessment
```

## üîÆ **Next Steps (Phase 4)**

According to the development plan, **Phase 4: CRM Tool Integration** should implement:
- Deal management tools (`search_deals`, `create_deal`, `update_deal`)
- Contact tools (`search_contacts`, `create_contact`)
- Organization tools (`search_organizations`, `create_organization`)
- Activity tools (`create_activity`, `search_activities`)

This will transform the V2 agent from a sophisticated chatbot into a **functional CRM assistant** with both thinking capabilities and practical business tools.
