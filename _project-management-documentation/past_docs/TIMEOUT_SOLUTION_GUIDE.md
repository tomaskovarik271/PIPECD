# AI Agent Timeout Solution Guide

## Problem Summary

The AI agent chat was disappearing due to **30-second timeout errors**. The logs showed:
```
◈ Function graphql has returned an error: Task timed out after 30.00 seconds
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The AI agent was working correctly with our MCP improvements:
- ✅ Think tool functioning properly
- ✅ Using real database IDs (no fake UUIDs)
- ✅ Following think-first methodology

But **multiple timeout layers** were causing failures.

## Timeout Architecture

### 1. **Application Layer Timeouts** ✅ FIXED
- **GraphQLClient**: 30s → **2 minutes**
- **ToolExecutor**: 30s → **2 minutes**

### 2. **Netlify Function Timeout** ⚠️ LIMITED
- **Local Development**: Hardcoded at 10 seconds in Netlify CLI
- **Production**: Configurable through UI (Pro plan required)

### 3. **Netlify CLI Limitation**
The local development timeout is hardcoded in the CLI source code:
```typescript
const SYNCHRONOUS_FUNCTION_TIMEOUT = 10
```

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ **Application-Level Fixes**
```typescript
// GraphQLClient timeout: 30s → 2 minutes
this.defaultTimeout = config.defaultTimeout || 120000;

// ToolExecutor timeout: 30s → 2 minutes  
timeout: 120000,
```

### ⚠️ **Local Development Workarounds**

#### Option 1: CLI Modification (Temporary)
If needed, you can modify the local CLI timeout:
1. Find your CLI installation: `which netlify`
2. Navigate to: `node_modules/netlify-cli/src/utils/dev.ts`
3. Change: `const SYNCHRONOUS_FUNCTION_TIMEOUT = 10` to `26`
4. **Note**: This resets on CLI updates

#### Option 2: Production Testing
For complex AI workflows, test on Netlify production where timeouts can be configured through the UI.

## Current Status

### ✅ **What's Working**
- **2-minute application timeouts** for individual operations
- **Think tool** preventing fake UUID generation
- **Sequential workflow** execution
- **Proper error handling** in application layer

### ⚠️ **Local Development Limitation**
- Netlify CLI still has 10-second hardcoded timeout
- Complex multi-step AI workflows may still timeout locally
- **Workaround**: Break complex operations into smaller steps

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. **Test simple operations locally** (under 10 seconds)
2. **Use production environment** for complex AI workflows
3. **Break down complex operations** into smaller steps
4. **Monitor application logs** to see where timeouts occur

### For Production
1. **Request timeout increase** through Netlify support (Pro plan)
2. **Application timeouts** (2 minutes) should handle most operations
3. **Think-first methodology** reduces processing time

## Testing Strategy

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test simple operations
"Create a deal with name 'Test Deal'"

# Avoid complex multi-step operations locally
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Complex operations work better in production
"Create a new deal for the same company as our ELE 2 deals with 120000"
```

## Monitoring

Watch for these patterns in logs:
- ✅ **Good**: `Claude autonomously suggested tool calls: [{ toolName: 'think' }]`
- ✅ **Good**: `Tool executed successfully: think`
- ❌ **Bad**: `Task timed out after 10.04 seconds`

## Future Improvements

1. **Netlify CLI Update**: Monitor for CLI updates that make timeout configurable
2. **Chunked Operations**: Break large operations into smaller, chainable steps
3. **Background Processing**: Consider using Inngest for long-running AI operations
4. **Caching**: Cache intermediate results to speed up repeated operations

## Status: ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED

- **Application timeouts**: Fixed (2 minutes)
- **Local development**: Limited by CLI (10 seconds)
- **Production**: Should work with proper timeout configuration
- **AI agent logic**: Working correctly with think-first methodology
