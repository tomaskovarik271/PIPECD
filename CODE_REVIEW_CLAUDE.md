4. **Accessibility** - Chakra UI provides good accessibility defaults

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Theme Consistency** - Multiple theme files with unused props and inconsistent patterns
2. **Component Reusability** - Some large components could be broken down
3. **Loading States** - Inconsistent loading state management across pages
4. **Error Handling** - User-facing error messages could be more user-friendly

### Scalability Considerations

#### Current Architecture Scalability
1. **Serverless Functions** - Good horizontal scaling potential
2. **Database** - Supabase provides good scaling capabilities
3. **Frontend** - Vite build system supports code splitting

#### Potential Bottlenecks
1. **Custom Field Processing** - Complex logic that could impact performance (now optimized)
2. **GraphQL N+1 Queries** - Potential for inefficient data fetching
3. **Bundle Size** - Unused dependencies and large components
4. **Database Queries** - Some queries could be optimized

#### Recommendations for Scale
1. **Implement Caching** - Redis or similar for frequently accessed data
