# Implementation Plan: Advanced Task & Activity Management

## Vision & Business Value

A best-in-class activity management system empowers users to create, assign, track, and complete tasks, calls, meetings, and other activities across multiple domains (sales, support, projects, etc.). It supports team collaboration, accountability, automation, and deep reporting, and is highly extensible for future needs.

**Key Business Benefits:**
- **Collaboration:** Assign, delegate, and share activities across teams and domains.
- **Accountability:** Every activity has a clear owner and status, with full audit history.
- **Productivity:** Users can focus on their assigned and relevant tasks, with reminders and notifications.
- **Automation:** Unlocks advanced workflow automations, round-robin assignment, and escalations.
- **Reporting:** Enables workload, performance, and SLA tracking by user, team, or domain.
- **Extensibility:** Supports new domains (support, projects, custom objects) and custom activity types.

---

## Features & Capabilities

- **Assignment & Delegation:** Assign activities to any user, reassign as needed, and filter by assignee.
- **Flexible Linking:** Link activities to multiple entities of any type (deals, people, tickets, projects, etc.) via a generic linking table.
- **Configurable Types:** Define custom activity types per workspace/domain (e.g., onboarding, bug fix, support call).
- **Rich Status:** Activities have a flexible status field (open, in_progress, done, blocked, cancelled, etc.), not just a boolean.
- **Reminders & Notifications:** Set reminders, receive notifications for assignments, due dates, and overdue activities.
- **Audit Trail:** Full audit/history table for all changes to activities (who changed what, when).
- **Advanced Filtering & Views:** Filter and sort by assignee, type, status, due date, linked entity, etc.
- **Automation Integration:** Activities can be created, updated, and reassigned by workflow automations, with support for escalations and cross-domain triggers.
- **Extensibility:** Designed for use across multiple domains, with per-domain configuration and cross-domain automation.
- **Testing & Risk Mitigation:** Emphasis on validation, permissions, and robust testing at every phase.

## System Architecture & Data Model

### Core Tables

- **activities**: The central table for all tasks, calls, meetings, etc. across all domains.
  - Key fields: `id`, `created_by_user_id`, `assigned_user_id`, `type_id`, `status`, `subject`, `due_date`, `reminder_at`, `is_done`, `notes`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **activity_types**: Configurable types per workspace/domain (e.g., call, meeting, bug fix).
- **activity_links**: Generic many-to-many linking table to associate activities with any entity (deal, person, ticket, project, etc.).
- **activity_history**: Audit trail for all changes to activities (who, what, when).

### How It Works

- **All activities/tasks for all domains are stored in the `activities` table.**
- **Linking to other entities** (deals, people, tickets, etc.) is handled via `activity_links`.
- **Assignment** is managed via `assigned_user_id` (can be reassigned at any time).
- **Types and statuses** are flexible and configurable.
- **Audit/history** is automatically recorded for every change.
- **Reminders and notifications** are scheduled and triggered by backend services.

### Services & API

- **Activity services** provide CRUD, filtering, assignment, status transitions, reminders, and history.
- **Filtering and querying** by assignee, creator, type, status, due date, linked entity, etc.
- **Frontend** interacts with these services for all forms, lists, detail views, and notifications.
- **Extensibility**: Adding new domains or types does not require schema changesâ€”just new records in `activity_types` or new entity types in `activity_links`.

### Phase Support Table

| Phase         | Supported by Core Tables/Services? | Notes                                                      |
|---------------|:----------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1       | Yes                                | Core schema, types, links, and history                     |
| Phase 2       | Yes                                | API/services for all CRUD, filtering, assignment, etc.     |
| Phase 3       | Yes                                | UI, notifications, reminders, history, advanced filtering  |
| Phase 4+      | Mostly (plus automation logic)     | May need more for automation triggers, escalations, etc.   |

## Example Use Cases
- Assign a follow-up call to a sales rep when a new deal is created.
- Delegate a support ticket to a specialist, with escalation if overdue.
- Automatically reassign overdue activities to a manager.
- Filter the activity list to "assigned to me", "created by me", "open", or "blocked".
- Link a task to multiple entities (deal, person, project).
- Add custom activity types (e.g., onboarding, bug fix) per workspace.
- Receive reminders and notifications for upcoming or overdue activities.
- View a full audit trail of changes to each activity.

      -- Activity audit/history table
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.activity_history (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
        activity_id UUID REFERENCES public.activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        changed_by_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
        change_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- created, updated, status_changed, reassigned, etc.
        changes JSONB,
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
      );
      CREATE INDEX idx_activity_history_activity_id ON public.activity_history(activity_id);
      ```
    * **Status:** Not Started
