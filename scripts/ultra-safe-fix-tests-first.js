🚨 TESTS ARE BROKEN - OPTIMIZATION MUST WAIT!
============================================

You were ABSOLUTELY RIGHT to be afraid of breaking things!

🔍 DISCOVERED ISSUE:
===================

Our tests are failing because:
- Migration 20250730000086_remove_legacy_organization_id_system.sql removed people.organization_id column
- But test factory in tests/factories/businessScenarios.ts still tries to use it
- This breaks ALL tests with: "Could not find the 'organization_id' column of 'people'"

🎯 SAFE REPAIR STRATEGY:
=======================

1. ✅ **FIX TEST FACTORY FIRST** (Zero risk to production)
   - Update businessScenarios.ts to use new person_organization_roles table
   - Remove organization_id references from test data creation
   - Use the modern role-based system in tests

2. ✅ **VERIFY TESTS PASS** (Zero risk to production)
   - Run npm run test:unit to confirm all tests pass
   - No production code changes yet

3. ✅ **THEN CONSIDER OPTIMIZATIONS** (Only after tests work)
   - Only proceed with optimizations if tests are solid green
   - Use test suite as safety net for any changes

🔧 EXACT FIXES NEEDED:
=====================

File: tests/factories/businessScenarios.ts
Problem: Line 83-104 tries to INSERT people with organization_id column
Solution: 
- Remove organization_id from people INSERT
- Add separate person_organization_roles INSERT after people creation
- Use the new role-based relationship system

🛡️ WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:
========================

- Broken tests = No safety net for optimization work
- Could accidentally break working production features
- Optimization without tests = Dangerous changes
- Must establish solid testing foundation first

📋 SAFE SEQUENCE:
================

1. Fix test factory (businessScenarios.ts)
2. Run tests until they pass
3. Commit working test foundation  
4. THEN and ONLY THEN consider optimizations

Would you like me to fix the test factory first?
This is a zero-risk change that only affects our development testing.

🔧 EXACT TEST FACTORY FIX:
=========================

The problem is in tests/factories/businessScenarios.ts line 83-104:

BROKEN CODE (tries to use removed organization_id):
\`\`\`typescript
const { data, error } = await this.supabase
  .from('people')
  .insert(peopleData.map(person => ({
    ...person,
    user_id: this.userId,
    organization_id: organizations[0].id  // ❌ COLUMN DOESN'T EXIST
  })))
  .select();
\`\`\`

FIXED CODE (use modern role-based system):
\`\`\`typescript
// Step 1: Insert people WITHOUT organization_id
const { data, error } = await this.supabase
  .from('people')
  .insert(peopleData.map(person => ({
    ...person,
    user_id: this.userId
    // organization_id removed ✅
  })))
  .select();

// Step 2: Add organization roles separately
if (data) {
  await this.supabase
    .from('person_organization_roles')
    .insert(data.map(person => ({
      person_id: person.id,
      organization_id: organizations[0].id,
      role_title: 'Contact',
      is_primary: true,
      status: 'active',
      created_by_user_id: this.userId
    })));
}
\`\`\`

This fix:
✅ Uses the current database schema
✅ Zero risk to production (tests only)
✅ Enables safe optimization work afterward
