# PipeCD Feature Discovery System

## Overview

PipeCD's Feature Discovery System provides intelligent, non-intrusive guidance for users discovering innovative CRM features that break traditional patterns. The system ensures new users get proper guidance while experienced users aren't overwhelmed with repetitive help.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show information when users need it, not before
2. **Contextual Relevance** - Guidance appears in the right place at the right time
3. **User Autonomy** - Users control their learning experience
4. **Persistent Memory** - System remembers what users have already learned
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Works even if discovery data is unavailable

### User Experience Goals
- **For New Users**: Clear guidance on innovative features
- **For Experienced Users**: Minimal interference with established workflows
- **For Power Users**: Advanced tips and shortcuts
- **For All Users**: Consistent, beautiful, and helpful interface

## System Architecture

### Components Hierarchy
```
FeatureDiscoveryProvider (Context)
├── FeatureTooltip (Basic tooltip guidance)
├── FeatureCallout (Prominent feature announcements)
├── FeatureSpotlight (Overlay-based feature highlighting)
├── FeatureTour (Multi-step guided tours)
└── FeatureDiscoveryPanel (Help panel with contextual tips)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Feature Registration** - Features register themselves with metadata
2. **User Progress Tracking** - System tracks which features users have discovered
3. **Context Detection** - System knows current page/component context
4. **Intelligent Display** - Shows appropriate guidance based on user state
5. **Persistence** - Saves user preferences and progress

## Implementation

### Core Service (`lib/featureDiscoveryService.ts`)
- **Feature Registration**: Central registry of all discoverable features
- **User Progress**: Tracks which features users have seen/used
- **Context Awareness**: Knows current page context for relevant suggestions
- **Display Logic**: Determines when and how to show guidance

### React Components
- **FeatureTooltip**: Subtle tooltip with rich content
- **FeatureCallout**: Dismissible alert-style announcements
- **FeatureSpotlight**: Overlay highlighting with explanation
- **FeatureTour**: Multi-step guided tours for complex workflows
- **FeatureDiscoveryPanel**: Contextual help sidebar

### Storage Strategy
- **LocalStorage**: User preferences and basic progress tracking
- **Database**: Advanced analytics and cross-device sync (future)
- **Feature Flags**: A/B testing different guidance approaches

## Feature Types & Use Cases

**Timing**: When integration is needed but not configured

## Configuration Schema

### Feature Definition
```typescript
interface FeatureDefinition {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  title: string;                 // Display name
  description: string;           // Detailed explanation
  category: FeatureCategory;     // Grouping for organization
  priority: Priority;            // Display importance
  contexts: string[];            // Where this feature applies
  type: GuidanceType;           // How to display guidance
  prerequisites?: string[];      // Required features/setup
  learnMoreUrl?: string;        // Link to documentation
  videoUrl?: string;            // Demo video
  estimatedTime?: number;       // Minutes to learn
}
```

### User Progress Tracking
```typescript
interface UserProgress {
  userId: string;
  discoveredFeatures: string[];     // Features user has seen
  completedTours: string[];         // Tours user has finished
  dismissedCallouts: string[];      // Callouts user has dismissed
  preferredGuidanceLevel: Level;    // User's help preference
  lastActiveDate: Date;             // For relevance scoring
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Register Features Early** - Add to registry when implementing new features
2. **Use Semantic IDs** - Clear, descriptive feature identifiers
3. **Write User-Focused Copy** - Explain benefits, not just functionality
4. **Test Guidance Flows** - Verify the discovery experience works smoothly
5. **Monitor Usage** - Track which guidance is actually helpful

### For Designers
1. **Maintain Visual Hierarchy** - Guidance shouldn't overpower main content
2. **Use Consistent Patterns** - Similar features should have similar guidance
3. **Design for Dismissal** - Always provide clear way to close/skip
4. **Consider Accessibility** - Ensure guidance works with screen readers
5. **Test with Real Users** - Validate that guidance actually helps

### For Product Managers
1. **Prioritize High-Impact Features** - Focus guidance on features that drive value
2. **Monitor Discovery Metrics** - Track feature adoption and guidance effectiveness
3. **Iterate Based on Feedback** - Continuously improve guidance based on user behavior
4. **Balance Innovation with Usability** - Don't let guidance become overwhelming

## Metrics & Analytics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Feature Discovery Rate** - % of users who find innovative features
- **Guidance Completion Rate** - % of users who complete tours/callouts
- **Feature Adoption Rate** - % of users who actually use discovered features
- **User Satisfaction** - Feedback on guidance helpfulness
