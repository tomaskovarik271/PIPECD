# CIO Report: Project <> Audit & Updated Roadmap

Date: 2024-10-28 (Audit Update)
Original Report Date: 2024-10-27
Auditor: AI Assistant (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

## 1. Introduction

This report presents a detailed static code analysis and audit of the project, comparing its current state against the provided `ROADMAP.md`. The objective is to offer a clear view of accomplishments, identify discrepancies, and provide an updated roadmap for the CIO. The audit was conducted by examining the codebase, configuration files, and available test evidence. This version updates the previous report with more current and critically verified findings.

## 2. Executive Summary

The project has made significant progress, with much of the foundational infrastructure and core CRUD functionalities for People, Deals, Organizations, Pipelines, Stages, and Activities in place. Key backend services are established, Supabase integration is functional, and corresponding frontend components exist. The adoption of TypeScript, Zod for validation, and RLS policies are positive indicators of quality and security considerations.

However, critical discrepancies persist between the original `ROADMAP.md` claims and the audited codebase state, particularly in:
*   **Testing Coverage:** Significant gaps remain in GraphQL resolver integration tests, frontend component tests, and E2E tests for several modules (Deals, Organizations, Pipelines, Activities). Some roadmap claims of test completion are incorrect.
*   **CI/CD Automation:** No GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD were found, despite claims of a basic pipeline.
*   **Code Formatting & Linting:** Prettier is not set up. ESLint configuration and integration (e.g., with Prettier) needs verification and likely completion.
*   **RBAC:** While a schema for RBAC exists and permissions are used in GraphQL, the system requires more comprehensive implementation and testing, especially regarding user role management and dynamic permission enforcement beyond basic checks. The `Organization.people` resolver is a known TODO.

**Key Achievements (Verified):**
*   Core backend infrastructure (Supabase, Inngest, GraphQL Yoga) is set up.
*   Database schema for all core entities (People, Deals, Organizations, Pipelines, Stages, Activities) is migrated and includes RLS.
*   CRUD services for People, Deals, Organizations, Pipelines, Stages, and Activities are implemented.
*   GraphQL schema and resolvers for these entities are largely in place.
*   Frontend setup with React, Chakra UI, Zustand, and a GraphQL client.
*   Extensive unit tests for backend services (People, Deals, Organizations, Pipelines, Stages), with `activityService.test.ts` being the notable exception (likely missing).
*   Basic E2E tests for Auth and People CRUD.

**Critical Gaps & Discrepancies:**
*   **Testing:**
    *   GraphQL resolver integration tests: Missing.
    *   Frontend component tests: Missing.
    *   E2E tests: Missing for Deals, Organizations, Pipelines, Activities, and RLS/RBAC.
    *   `activityService.test.ts`: Likely missing.
*   **CI/CD:** Not implemented.
*   **Code Quality Tooling:** Prettier not installed/configured. ESLint setup needs review.
*   **RBAC:** Implementation is partial. `Organization.people` resolver is a TODO. Full end-to-end testing of permission logic is needed.
*   **Inngest Client ID:** `TODO` in `inngest.ts` for client ID. Main Netlify handler export in `inngest.ts` may be a placeholder.
*   **Roadmap Accuracy:** The original `ROADMAP.md` contains numerous inaccuracies regarding task completion, especially for testing and advanced features.

**High-Level Recommendations:**
1.  **Prioritize Test Coverage:** Address all missing test categories (resolver, component, E2E). Add `activityService.test.ts`.
2.  **Implement Full RBAC & Resolve TODOs:** Complete the RBAC implementation, including the `Organization.people` resolver and comprehensive testing.
3.  **Establish CI/CD & Code Quality:** Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Install and configure Prettier and ESLint.
4.  **Address Inngest `TODO`s**: Resolve the client ID and review the handler export.
5.  **Adopt This Updated Roadmap:** Use the corrected roadmap statuses from this report for future planning.

## 5. Conclusion

Substantial progress has been made, and core functionalities are largely operational. The immediate priorities should be to address the gaps in testing, complete the RBAC implementation, establish robust CI/CD pipelines, and implement code quality tools like Prettier and a full ESLint setup. Correcting the roadmap based on this audit will provide a realistic baseline for future planning and resource allocation.
