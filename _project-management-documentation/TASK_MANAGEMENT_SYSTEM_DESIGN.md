# PipeCD Task Management System Design

## Executive Summary

PipeCD's task management system is designed as a **CRM-native, deal/lead-centric** task system that embeds directly into business processes rather than operating as a standalone task manager. Drawing inspiration from Todoist, Asana, and Monday.com, the system prioritizes revenue-driving activities and automates CRM workflows.

      { field: "wfm_step", operator: "EQUALS", value: "QUALIFICATION" }
    ],
    actions: [
      {
        type: "CREATE_TASK",
        template: "enterprise_deal_follow_up",
        data: {
          taskType: "FOLLOW_UP",
          priority: "HIGH",
          dueInDays: 2,
          blocksStageProgression: true
        }
      }

The task system uses a comprehensive database schema that prioritizes CRM integration:

```sql
-- Core task table with full CRM integration
CREATE TABLE public.tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status task_status_enum NOT NULL DEFAULT 'TODO',
  priority task_priority_enum NOT NULL DEFAULT 'MEDIUM',
  task_type task_type_enum NOT NULL,
  
  -- CRM Integration (Always Required)
  entity_type task_entity_type NOT NULL,
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Specific Entity Links
  deal_id UUID REFERENCES public.deals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  lead_id UUID REFERENCES public.leads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  person_id UUID REFERENCES public.people(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES public.organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  
  -- Assignment & Ownership
  assigned_to_user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_by_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
  
  -- Scheduling
  due_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  
  -- Business Logic Integration
  completion_triggers_stage_change BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  blocks_stage_progression BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  required_for_deal_closure BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  affects_lead_scoring BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  
  -- Workflow Integration
  wfm_project_id UUID REFERENCES public.wfm_projects(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  automation_rule_id UUID REFERENCES public.task_automation_rules(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  parent_task_id UUID REFERENCES public.tasks(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  
  -- Metadata & Tracking
  custom_field_values JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  tags TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  estimated_hours INTEGER,
  actual_hours INTEGER,
  calculated_priority REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  business_impact_score REAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Design ‚úÖ

The GraphQL API provides comprehensive task management capabilities:

**Key Queries:**
- `tasksForDeal(dealId: ID!)` - Context-aware task loading
- `myTasks(filters: TaskFiltersInput)` - Personal task management
- `myOverdueTasks` - Priority task identification
- `taskStats(entityType, entityId)` - Progress analytics

**Key Mutations:**
- `createTask(input: CreateTaskInput!)` - Full task creation
- `completeTask(id: ID!, completionData: TaskCompletionInput)` - Business logic triggers
- `triggerTaskAutomation(event: CRMEventInput!)` - Workflow automation

### Frontend Architecture ‚úÖ

The frontend implements a comprehensive task management interface:

**DealTasksPanel Features:**
- **Advanced Filtering**: Status, priority, assignee, task type
- **Smart Sorting**: Priority, due date, creation date
- **Progress Visualization**: Completion rates and overdue indicators
- **Quick Actions**: Status updates, task completion, assignment
- **Business Logic Indicators**: Visual indicators for critical tasks
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes

## Core Philosophy

### CRM-Native Integration

- **No Standalone Tasks**: Every task exists within deal/lead context
- **Business Outcome Focused**: Tasks drive revenue, conversions, and relationship building
- **Embedded Workflows**: Tasks are integral to sales/lead management processes
- **Contextual Creation**: Tasks created from within deal/lead detail pages

### Revenue-Driven Task Management

Unlike general task managers, PipeCD's system prioritizes tasks based on business impact:

- **Deal Value Integration**: Higher value deals generate higher priority tasks
- **Stage Progression**: Tasks can block or trigger deal stage changes
- **Lead Scoring**: Task completion affects lead qualification scores
- **Conversion Optimization**: Task types designed around sales funnel activities

### Intelligent Automation

The system learns from user behavior and automates routine task creation:

- **Stage-Based Triggers**: Automatic task creation when deals advance
- **Lead Behavior**: Tasks generated from lead interaction patterns  
- **Time-Based Rules**: Recurring tasks for relationship maintenance
- **Completion Cascades**: Task completion triggering follow-up activities

## Task Types & Categories

### Deal Progression Tasks
- **Discovery**: Understanding client needs and pain points
- **Demo Preparation**: Technical demonstrations and presentations
- **Proposal Creation**: Detailed proposal and pricing development
- **Negotiation Prep**: Strategy development for contract discussions
- **Contract Review**: Legal and technical contract evaluation
- **Deal Closure**: Final steps to complete the sale

### Lead Management Tasks  
- **Lead Qualification**: BANT/MEDDIC qualification processes
- **Lead Nurturing**: Educational content and relationship building
- **Follow-up**: Systematic communication scheduling
- **Lead Scoring Review**: Qualification score updates and validation

### Relationship Tasks
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Decision maker identification and influence analysis
- **Relationship Building**: Strategic relationship development activities
- **Renewal Preparation**: Customer success and expansion planning

### Administrative CRM Tasks

## Business Logic Integration

### Deal Stage Management

Tasks integrate directly with PipeCD's Workflow Management (WFM) system:

- **Stage Progression**: Certain tasks must be completed before deal advancement
- **Automatic Task Creation**: New deal stages trigger relevant task templates
- **Probability Updates**: Task completion can influence deal close probability
- **Timeline Management**: Tasks provide structured approach to deal progression

### Lead Qualification Enhancement

Task completion directly affects lead scoring algorithms:

- **Qualification Tasks**: BANT/MEDDIC framework implementation
- **Engagement Tracking**: Task completion indicates lead engagement level
- **Scoring Automation**: Automated lead score updates based on task outcomes
- **Conversion Optimization**: Task patterns that correlate with successful conversions

### Priority Calculation Algorithm

Tasks use sophisticated priority calculation considering:

```typescript
calculateTaskPriority = (task) => {
  const businessImpact = getEntityValue(task.entityType, task.entityId);
  const timeUrgency = calculateTimeUrgency(task.dueDate);
  const blockingWeight = task.blocksStageProgression ? 2.0 : 1.0;
  const closureWeight = task.requiredForDealClosure ? 3.0 : 1.0;
  
  return (businessImpact * timeUrgency * blockingWeight * closureWeight);
}
```

## User Experience Design

### Contextual Task Management

Users never leave their primary workflow to manage tasks:

- **Embedded Interface**: Tasks appear within deal/lead detail pages
- **Contextual Creation**: New tasks automatically inherit parent entity context
- **Seamless Navigation**: No context switching between CRM and task management
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Task properties pre-populated based on entity context

### Visual Priority System

Tasks use color-coded priority system with business context:

- **Priority Indicators**: Visual priority using business impact, not just user preference
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators for deal/lead progression impact  
- **Overdue Emphasis**: Clear highlighting of time-sensitive tasks
- **Completion Celebration**: Visual feedback for task completion and business impact

### Mobile-First Design

Task management optimized for mobile CRM usage:

- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: Large touch targets for mobile task management
- **Offline Capability**: Core task operations available offline
- **Quick Actions**: Swipe gestures for common task operations
- **Voice Input**: Voice-to-text for rapid task creation

## Integration Architecture
