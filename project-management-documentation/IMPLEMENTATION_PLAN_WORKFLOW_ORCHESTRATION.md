# Implementation Plan: Workflow Orchestration Engine Adoption

## 1. Vision & Business Value

**Vision:** To implement a robust, scalable workflow orchestration engine that automates and manages business processes spanning multiple microservices within our ecosystem. This engine will serve as a central coordinator, improving reliability, visibility, and efficiency of cross-service operations.

**Business Value:**
*   **Automation:** Automate complex, multi-step processes that involve both system actions (API calls, data transformations) and human tasks.
*   **Reliability & Resilience:** Improve the fault tolerance of cross-service processes through explicit workflow state management, automatic retries, and error handling capabilities. Address challenges of eventual consistency using defined patterns.
*   **Visibility & Monitoring:** Gain clear insight into the status of running business processes, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues more effectively.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduce manual handoffs between systems and people, speeding up process execution.
*   **Scalability:** Provide a scalable foundation for adding more complex workflows and integrating new services as the ecosystem grows.
*   **Standardization:** Utilize BPMN 2.0 as a standard language for defining and discussing business processes across technical and potentially non-technical teams.

## 2. Core Architecture & Technical Decisions

*   **Engine Strategy:** **Adopt** an existing workflow engine rather than building one from scratch. Focus effort on integration and workflow implementation.
*   **Workflow Definition Standard:** Utilize **BPMN 2.0** for defining and modeling workflows, leveraging its visual standard and rich feature set.
*   **Engine Integration with Existing Architecture:** 
    *   Your existing **GraphQL API (running on Netlify Serverless Functions)** will serve as a primary service interface. It can initiate workflows and be called by task workers.
    *   Microservices (if any, now or in the future) and the GraphQL API will interact with the engine primarily via well-defined APIs (e.g., REST) or language-specific clients provided by the engine vendor.
    *   Interaction points include: starting workflow instances, signaling events, querying instance status.
*   **Task Workers:**
    *   Implement separate, dedicated **Task Workers**. These can be **serverless functions (e.g., Netlify Functions, Inngest functions)** or lightweight, dedicated services.
    *   Workers subscribe to specific "System Task" topics defined in the BPMN models.
    *   These workers execute automated logic (e.g., calling external APIs, interacting with your GraphQL API or other services, performing data processing) and report completion or failure back to the engine.
*   **User Task Integration:**
    *   Human tasks defined in BPMN will be integrated with the existing/planned "Advanced Task & Activity Management" system (which is part of your GraphQL API service).
    *   Adapters/workers (which can also be serverless functions) will translate engine user tasks into concrete activities in the Activity system and signal completion back to the engine when the user marks the activity as done.
*   **Consistency Patterns:** Acknowledge the need for managing eventual consistency in distributed workflows (e.g., **Saga pattern**) and plan for their implementation where necessary, especially for long-running processes or those requiring compensation logic.

## 3. MVP Scope

The initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on implementing and validating one end-to-end workflow:

*   **Target Workflow:** Select a single, well-understood, business-critical process that involves interactions between at least your **GraphQL API service** and one other system (e.g., an external API, or another internal service if one exists), and includes both system and human tasks. (e.g., "New Customer Onboarding," "Complex Order Fulfillment").
*   **Included Tasks:**
    *   At least one **System Task** (e.g., fetch customer data from an external KYC API).
    *   At least one **Human Task** (e.g., "Review Application," "Approve Discount"), integrated with the Activity Management system.
*   **Core Engine Functionality:** Successfully deploy, execute, and monitor instances of the MVP workflow.
*   **Basic Monitoring:** Provide developers/ops with the ability to view the status of running and completed MVP workflow instances, including basic error information.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Engine Selection & Proof of Concept (PoC)

*   **Action 1.1:** Define Detailed Requirements & Evaluation Criteria
    *   Document specific technical needs (BPMN feature support, scalability requirements, monitoring capabilities, integration patterns).
    *   Define operational criteria (hosting options - self-hosted vs. cloud, cost, support, community activity).
    *   Define team-fit criteria (ease of use, required skillset, documentation quality).
*   **Action 1.2:** Identify & Shortlist Candidate Engines
    *   Research engines with strong BPMN 2.0 support (e.g., Camunda Platform 8 / Zeebe, Flowable, potentially others). *Note: While Temporal is powerful, it's code-first and doesn't natively use BPMN for execution.*
    *   Create a shortlist based on initial requirements alignment.
*   **Action 1.3:** Evaluate Shortlisted Candidates
    *   Perform deeper analysis based on evaluation criteria.
    *   Install/access trial versions locally or in a sandbox environment.
    *   Assess documentation and community support channels.
*   **Action 1.4:** Select Engine
    *   Make a final decision based on the evaluation.
*   **Action 1.5:** Implement Minimal PoC Workflow
    *   Model a very simple "hello world" style workflow in BPMN (e.g., Start -> System Task (Log Message) -> End).
    *   Set up the engine locally.
    *   Implement a basic task worker for the system task.
    *   Successfully deploy and run an instance of the PoC workflow.
    *   **Goal:** Validate basic engine operation, worker connection, and deployment process.
*   **1R: Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure PoC realistically tests core integration assumptions.
    *   Verify alignment between engine capabilities and required BPMN features.
    *   Confirm chosen engine's hosting model fits infrastructure strategy and budget.
    *   Assess initial learning curve for the team.

### Phase 2: MVP Workflow Implementation - Backend & Engine Setup

*   **Action 2.1:** Design MVP Workflow in BPMN 2.0
    *   Create the detailed BPMN diagram for the selected MVP workflow, clearly identifying service tasks (which might call your GraphQL API or external APIs), user tasks, sequence flows, and any necessary gateways.
*   **Action 2.2:** Setup Workflow Engine Environment
    *   Provision and configure the chosen engine in a development/staging environment (cloud or self-hosted).
    *   Configure necessary security, logging, and persistence.
*   **Action 2.3:** Develop Task Workers for MVP
    *   Implement the worker(s) – **as serverless functions (e.g., Netlify Functions) or dedicated services** – for the MVP's **System Task(s)**.
        *   Include logic for interacting with external APIs or your GraphQL API.
        *   Implement error handling and retry logic within the worker.
        *   Handle secure credential management.
    *   Implement the adapter/worker (can also be a serverless function) responsible for **Human Task** integration:
        *   Listen for user tasks activated by the engine.
        *   Create corresponding tasks in the "Advanced Task & Activity Management" system (via your GraphQL API).
        *   Listen for completion events from the Activity system.
        *   Signal task completion back to the workflow engine.
*   **Action 2.4:** Deploy MVP Workflow Definition
    *   Package and deploy the BPMN 2.0 model to the configured engine environment.
*   **2R: Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Securely manage API keys/credentials used by system task workers and for accessing your GraphQL API.
    *   Define clear contracts between the engine and task workers.
    *   Implement robust error handling and logging within workers.
    *   Consider idempotency for task workers where applicable.
    *   Plan for engine resource requirements (CPU, memory, storage).

### Phase 3: MVP Workflow Implementation - Service Integration & Frontend

*   **Action 3.1:** Modify Involved Services (Your GraphQL API and any other relevant services)
    *   Update your **GraphQL API (Netlify Functions)** if it's responsible for initiating the MVP workflow instance, enabling it to call the engine's API.
    *   If the workflow relies on events *from* your GraphQL API or other services, ensure those events are published correctly and potentially consumed by the engine or workers (Inngest can be valuable here).
    *   Ensure your GraphQL API exposes necessary endpoints if it needs to be called *by* task workers to complete system tasks.
*   **Action 3.2:** Integrate Human Tasks with Activity Management UI (via your GraphQL API)
    *   Ensure the "Advanced Task & Activity Management" system's UI (part of your JS frontend, interacting with your GraphQL API) can display human tasks originating from the workflow engine.
    *   Ensure users can action these tasks (e.g., mark as complete), triggering the necessary signal back to the engine via the adapter developed in Phase 2.
*   **Action 3.3:** Implement Basic Monitoring/Visibility Interface
    *   Utilize the chosen engine's built-in monitoring tools (if sufficient for MVP).
    *   If needed, build a simple internal dashboard page to query the engine's API for the status of MVP workflow instances.
*   **3R: Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Define and manage clear API contracts between your GraphQL API, other services (if any), workers, and the engine.
    *   Address potential distributed consistency issues for the MVP workflow (research/apply Saga pattern basics if required).
    *   Test communication reliability between all components. Ensure firewalls/networking allow necessary connections.

### Phase 4: Testing, Deployment & Monitoring

*   **Action 4.1:** Develop Integration & End-to-End Tests
    *   Create tests simulating the full MVP workflow execution, including worker interactions and human task completion.
    *   Test various paths, including error conditions.
*   **Action 4.2:** Test Failure Scenarios
    *   Simulate task worker failures and verify retry mechanisms.
    *   Simulate external API outages.
    *   Test engine recovery capabilities (if applicable to hosting model).
*   **Action 4.3:** Deploy to Staging/Production
    *   Deploy the configured engine.
    *   Deploy task worker serverless functions/services.
    *   Deploy updates to your GraphQL API (Netlify Functions) and any other microservices involved in the MVP workflow.
    *   Deploy updates to the Activity Management system/UI (via your frontend application).
*   **Action 4.4:** Implement Monitoring & Alerting
    *   Set up monitoring dashboards for the engine's health and performance.
    *   Configure alerts for engine errors, persistent task failures, or critical workflow failures.
    *   Ensure adequate logging from the engine and all task workers.
*   **4R: Risk Mitigation:**
    *   Develop a clear deployment/rollback strategy for all components (engine, workers, services).
    *   Perform load testing if the MVP workflow is high-volume.
    *   Establish operational runbooks for common failure scenarios.
