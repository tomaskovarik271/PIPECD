# Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Custom CRM System

**Status:** PRODUCTION | **Date:** 2025-05-01 (Updated: 2025-01-15)

## 1. Context

This document outlines the architectural decisions for building a custom Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system intended to replace Pipedrive. The system aims to be scalable, maintainable, secure, and ready for future expansion into adjacent business domains (e.g., Accounting, Logistics), aligning with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. 

**ðŸš€ CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION-READY ENTERPRISE CRM WITH REVOLUTIONARY AI & ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT**

The system has achieved **full production readiness** with revolutionary AI V2 capabilities featuring critical architecture fixes, comprehensive lead management, enterprise notification infrastructure, complete Gmail integration with email management features, event-driven automation, **ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**, **ORGANIZATION DETAIL PAGE REDESIGN**, **BI-DIRECTIONAL LEAD-DEAL CONVERSION**, **INTELLIGENT DUPLICATE DETECTION**, and **ENHANCED EMAIL-TO-TASK WITH CLAUDE 3 HAIKU**. This ADR reflects the current implemented state with latest enterprise enhancements and proven architectural decisions.

## 2. Goal

**âœ… ACHIEVED:** Build a custom CRM system leveraging a serverless architecture deployed on Netlify, with robust security, compliance, and scalability features, designed for future extensibility.

**ðŸŽ¯ DELIVERED CAPABILITIES:**
- **Revolutionary AI Agent V2** - Claude 4 Sonnet with 30+ tools, enhanced streaming, and critical architecture fixes
- **Enterprise Activity Reminders** - Multi-channel notification infrastructure with email, in-app, and push capabilities
- **Complete Leads Management** - Full qualification workflows with AI scoring and conversion
- **Enhanced Email-to-Task** - Claude 3 Haiku AI integration with user confirmation and email scope selection
- **Custom Fields Democratization** - All users can create custom fields via AI conversation
- **Event-Driven Automation** - Inngest-powered assignment and workflow automation
- **Production-Ready Security** - JWT authentication with Row-Level Security enforcement
- **Enterprise Stability** - Memory leak prevention, performance optimization, and crash prevention

## 3. Core Principles

1.  **âœ… Logically Decomposed Services:** Successfully implemented independent backend logic modules in `/lib` structure, aligned with DDD principles. All services follow proven object-based patterns.
2.  **âœ… GraphQL API Layer:** Central GraphQL Gateway (GraphQL Yoga) provides unified, typed API. Proven effective for complex AI tool integrations.
3.  **âœ… Serverless First:** Netlify Functions with Supabase successfully handle production workloads with excellent performance.
4.  **âœ… Local First Development:** Efficient local development achieved with `netlify dev` and `supabase start`.
5.  **âœ… Clear Separation of Concerns:** Well-defined boundaries between Frontend, GraphQL Gateway, Backend Logic, Database, and AI systems.
6.  **âœ… Infrastructure as Code:** Configurations in `netlify.toml` and Supabase migrations successfully manage production deployment.
7.  **âœ… Security by Default:** Authentication (Supabase JWT), RLS, and GraphQL security measures successfully protect production data.
8.  **âœ… Leverage Managed Services:** Supabase, Netlify, and Inngest provide excellent managed service foundation.
9.  **âœ… Data Integrity & Privacy:** RLS enforcement and event-driven compliance workflows successfully protect user data.
10. **âœ… Automated Testing & Deployment:** Vitest and Playwright provide comprehensive testing coverage. Netlify CI/CD handles automated deployment.
11. **âœ… Event-Driven Architecture:** Inngest successfully handles background tasks, deal assignment automation, and lead assignment workflows.
12. **âœ… Stable Dependencies:** Latest stable versions (LTS Node, stable libraries) provide reliable foundation.
13. **âœ… Future Extensibility:** Architecture successfully supports AI Agent expansion, lead management addition, and custom fields democratization.

## 4. Architecture Outline

*   **Frontend:** React SPA (built with Vite - See ADR-002), communicates via GraphQL. Hosted on Netlify CDN.
*   **API Layer:** GraphQL (**GraphQL Yoga** on Netlify Function) at `/graphql`. Authenticates requests (Supabase JWT), performs authorization checks, validates inputs, and orchestrates data fetching/mutations by calling backend logic modules or Supabase directly for simple cases.
*   **Backend Logic:** Domain-specific Node.js/TypeScript modules located **within a `/lib` directory** in the project structure. Contains business logic, complex validation, and database interactions. Invoked by GraphQL resolvers or Inngest handlers. (Future: May refactor into a `packages/` monorepo if complexity warrants).
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with RLS enabled. Accessed primarily by backend logic modules via Supabase client library. Migrations managed via Supabase CLI.
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth. JWT passed from Frontend to Gateway via `Authorization` header.
*   **Asynchronous Workflows:** Inngest for event-driven, cross-service communication and background task processing (e.g., post-mutation workflows, data cleanup, GDPR erasure, future A2A communication bus - See ADR-003). Requires an Inngest handler Netlify Function (`/api/inngest`).
*   **File Storage:** Supabase Storage for user uploads, etc. Accessed via Supabase client library.
*   **Deployment:** Netlify handles frontend hosting, GraphQL Gateway function, Inngest handler function. CI/CD via Netlify Build/GitHub Actions. Secrets managed via Netlify environment variables (populated from `.env` locally, `.env` is gitignored).
