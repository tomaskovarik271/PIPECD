```bash
# Task Notification System
node test-task-notifications.js

# Mention System (requires auth token)
AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here node test-mention-system.js
```

## ðŸ“‹ Task Notification System Test Scenarios

### Test Script: `test-task-notifications.js`

#### **Scenario 1: Task Due Today Notifications**
- **Purpose**: Verify scheduled notifications for tasks due today
- **Test Data**: Creates task with `due_date = today`
- **Expected Behavior**: 
  - Task created successfully
  - Would trigger `task_due_today` notification via scheduled function
  - Notification includes task context and priority
- **Validation**: Script detects tasks due today that would trigger notifications

#### **Scenario 2: Overdue Task Notifications**
- **Purpose**: Verify scheduled notifications for overdue tasks  
- **Test Data**: Creates task with `due_date = 2 days ago`
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Task created successfully
  - Would trigger `task_overdue` notification via scheduled function
  - Notification includes days overdue calculation
- **Validation**: Script detects overdue tasks and calculates days overdue

#### **Scenario 3: Task Assignment Notifications (Real-time)**
- **Purpose**: Verify immediate notifications when tasks are assigned
- **Test Data**: Creates task assigned to different user than creator
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Task created successfully
  - `task_assigned` notification created immediately
  - Notification sent to assigned user (not creator)
- **Validation**: Script checks for notification within 1 second

#### **Scenario 4: Scheduled Function Simulation**
- **Purpose**: Simulate the Inngest scheduled function behavior
- **Test Data**: Queries existing tasks in database
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Identifies tasks due today (9 AM weekday schedule)
  - Identifies overdue tasks with day calculations
  - Shows what notifications would be created
- **Validation**: Comprehensive report of notification-triggering tasks

### Manual Task Testing Scenarios

#### **MT-1: Assignment Notification Flow**
1. Login as User A
2. Go to deal detail page â†’ Activities tab
3. Create task assigned to User B with due date tomorrow
4. **Expected**: User B receives `task_assigned` notification immediately
5. **Verify**: Check Universal Notification Center as User B

#### **MT-2: Due Today Notification Flow**
1. Create task with due date = today
2. Wait for 9 AM weekday (or manually trigger Inngest function)
3. **Expected**: Assigned user receives `task_due_today` notification
4. **Verify**: Notification shows task title, entity context, due date

#### **MT-3: Overdue Escalation Flow**
1. Create task with due date = yesterday
2. Wait for 9 AM weekday scheduled run
3. **Expected**: Assigned user receives `task_overdue` notification
4. **Verify**: Notification shows days overdue, priority escalation

## ðŸ’¬ Mention System Test Scenarios

### Test Script: `test-mention-system.js`

#### **Scenario 1: Single User Mention**
- **Purpose**: Verify basic @mention functionality
- **Test Data**: Sticker with content mentioning one user
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Sticker created with mentions array populated
  - `user_mentioned` notification created for mentioned user
  - Notification excludes creator (no self-notification)
- **Validation**: Checks notification count, metadata, and user targeting

#### **Scenario 2: Multiple User Mentions**
- **Purpose**: Verify multiple @mentions in single sticker
- **Test Data**: Sticker mentioning 2+ users in content
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - All mentioned users receive individual notifications
  - Each notification has correct user-specific metadata
  - Creator excluded from notifications
- **Validation**: Verifies correct notification count and distribution

#### **Scenario 3: Self-Mention Exclusion**
- **Purpose**: Verify users don't get notified for self-mentions
- **Test Data**: Sticker where creator mentions themselves
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Sticker created with self in mentions array
  - No notification created (self-mention exclusion)
- **Validation**: Confirms zero notifications created

#### **Scenario 4: Invalid User Filtering**
- **Purpose**: Verify system handles invalid user IDs gracefully
- **Test Data**: Mentions array with mix of valid/invalid user IDs
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Invalid user IDs filtered out during processing
  - Only valid users stored in mentions array
  - Only valid users receive notifications
- **Validation**: Confirms mention array contains only valid IDs

#### **Scenario 5: Mention Updates (New Mentions Only)**
- **Purpose**: Verify updating stickers with new mentions
- **Test Data**: Update existing sticker to add new mentions
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Only newly mentioned users receive notifications
  - Previously mentioned users don't get duplicate notifications
  - System tracks mention history correctly
- **Validation**: Checks notification creation for new mentions only

### Manual Mention Testing Scenarios

#### **MM-1: Rich Text Editor Integration**
1. Go to deal detail â†’ Sticker Board tab
2. Create new sticker
3. Type `@` in content area
4. **Expected**: Dropdown shows real users from system
5. Select user from dropdown
6. Save sticker
7. **Verify**: Mentioned user receives notification

#### **MM-2: Real-time User Search**
1. In sticker editor, type `@j` 
2. **Expected**: Dropdown filters to users with names/emails containing 'j'
3. **Verify**: Search works with both display names and email addresses

#### **MM-3: Visual Mention Display**
1. Create sticker with mentions
2. **Expected**: Mentions appear with special styling (`.rich-text-mention` class)
3. View sticker in read-only mode
4. **Verify**: Mentions maintain visual distinction

#### **MM-4: Cross-Entity Mention Context**
1. Create sticker on Deal A mentioning User B
2. **Expected**: User B's notification includes Deal A context
3. **Verify**: Notification metadata contains correct entity information

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Testing Scenarios

### **Integration Test: Task + Mention Workflow**
1. Create task assigned to User A
2. User A creates sticker on task mentioning User B
3. **Expected Notifications**:
   - User A: `task_assigned` notification
   - User B: `user_mentioned` notification
4. **Verify**: Both notification types work together

### **Performance Test: Bulk Mentions**

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Task Notification Issues
- **No assignment notifications**: Check GraphQL resolver integration
- **Scheduled notifications not working**: Verify Inngest function deployment
- **Wrong notification timing**: Check timezone handling in date calculations

### Mention System Issues
- **Mentions not saving**: Verify GraphQL schema includes mentions field
- **No notifications created**: Check smartStickersService mention processing
- **Invalid users not filtered**: Verify validateMentionedUsers function
- **Rich editor not showing users**: Check useUserListStore integration

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Analytics

### Notification Metrics to Track
- **Creation Rate**: Notifications created per hour/day
- **Read Rate**: Percentage of notifications marked as read
- **Response Time**: Time from trigger to notification creation
- **Error Rate**: Failed notification creation attempts

### Database Queries for Monitoring
```sql
-- Notification summary by type
SELECT notification_type, COUNT(*), AVG(CASE WHEN read_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as read_rate
FROM system_notifications 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY notification_type;

-- Recent mention activity
SELECT COUNT(*) as mention_count, DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour
FROM system_notifications 
WHERE notification_type = 'user_mentioned'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour ORDER BY hour;
```
