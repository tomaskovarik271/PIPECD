# This file now only extends the Query type with fields not present in base.graphql.
# Assumes 'type Query' is defined elsewhere (e.g., in base.graphql).

# Add other types as needed...

# --- Query Type ---

extend type Query {
  myPermissions: [String!]
  # All other Query fields (deals, people, health, etc.) are presumably defined in base.graphql
  # and should not be repeated here to avoid conflicts.
}

# If this schema were to also introduce new mutations not in base.graphql,
# and if base.graphql defines 'type Mutation', you would use:
# extend type Mutation {
#   newMutationFromSchemaFile: String
