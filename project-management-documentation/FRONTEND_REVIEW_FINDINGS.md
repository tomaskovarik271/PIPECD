# Frontend Review: Findings

This document outlines the findings from a review of the frontend codebase, focusing on its architecture, technology stack, and adherence to modern development practices. All version numbers are referenced from `frontend/package.json`.

## 1. Core Stack & Build Tools

*   **Framework**: React `^18.2.0` is used, allowing access to the latest React features.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).
*   **Build Tool**: Vite (`^6.3.4`) is employed for development and builds.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (devDependencies).
    *   Configuration in `frontend/vite.config.ts` includes `@vitejs/plugin-react` (`^4.4.1`) for React support.
*   **Language**: TypeScript (`~5.7.2`) is used across the project.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (devDependencies).
    *   The application-specific configuration in `frontend/tsconfig.app.json` is robust:
        *   `"target": "ES2020"` and `"module": "ESNext"` for modern JavaScript.
        *   `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` aligns with Vite's bundling strategy.
        *   `"jsx": "react-jsx"` enables the new JSX transform.
        *   `"strict": true` along with `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, etc., enforce high code quality.
    *   A solution-style `frontend/tsconfig.json` references `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`, organizing different TypeScript contexts.
*   **Linting**: ESLint (`^9.22.0`) is configured using the flat config format in `frontend/eslint.config.js`.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (devDependencies), `frontend/eslint.config.js`.
    *   Integrates `typescript-eslint` (`^8.26.1`) for TypeScript-specific rules (`tseslint.configs.recommended`).
    *   Includes essential plugins: `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` (`^5.2.0`) and `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` (`^0.4.19`).
    *   Ignores the `dist` directory as specified in `frontend/eslint.config.js`.

## 2. UI & Styling

*   **UI Library**: Chakra UI (`@chakra-ui/react` version `^2.8.2`) is the primary UI component library. Chakra Icons (`@chakra-ui/icons` `^2.2.4`) are also included.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).
*   **Styling**: The presence of `frontend/src/index.css` and `frontend/src/App.css` (seen in directory listings) suggests global styles or specific overrides complement Chakra UI.
*   **Theme**:
    *   A `frontend/src/theme/` directory (seen in directory listings) indicates custom theming for Chakra UI.
    *   A `frontend/src/stores/useThemeStore.ts` (seen in directory listings) suggests dynamic theme capabilities (e.g., light/dark mode).

## 3. State Management

*   **Client-Side State**: Zustand (`^5.0.4`) is used for global client-side state management.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).
    *   Stores are modularized by feature/domain within `frontend/src/stores/` (e.g., `useDealsStore.ts`, `usePeopleStore.ts`, `useAppStore.ts`), as seen in directory listings.
*   **Server-Side State (Data Fetching & Caching)**: TanStack React Query (`^5.75.1`) is used.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).

## 4. Routing

*   **Library**: React Router DOM (`^7.5.3` as listed in `frontend/package.json`, though this might be a pre-release or typo for a recent v6 like `^6.25.3` as v7 is not yet stable. `@types/react-router-dom` is `^5.3.3` which is for v5, indicating a potential version mismatch or outdated types that should be updated to match the actual `react-router-dom` version being used).
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).
*   **Organization**: Page components are located in `frontend/src/pages/` (e.g., `DealsPage.tsx`, `DealDetailPage.tsx`), a conventional structure seen in directory listings.

## 5. Forms

*   **Library**: React Hook Form (`^7.56.1`) is used for managing forms.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).
*   **Validation**: Zod (`^3.24.3`) is used for schema definition and validation.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).

## 6. API Interaction & Data Handling

*   **GraphQL**: The project uses GraphQL (`graphql` version `^16.11.0`).
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).
    *   `@graphql-codegen/cli` (`^5.0.6`) is set up as per `frontend/codegen.ts`.
        *   Schema path: `../netlify/functions/graphql/schema/**/*.graphql`.
        *   Documents scanned from: `src/**/*.tsx`.
        *   Output to: `src/generated/graphql/`.
        *   Uses `preset: "client"` (`@graphql-codegen/client-preset` `^4.8.1`).
        *   Configuration includes `enumsAsTypes: true`, `strictScalars: true`, `useTypeImports: true`, and scalar mapping for `DateTime: 'string'`.
*   **Backend Services**: Supabase JS client (`@supabase/supabase-js` `^2.49.4`) is integrated.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).
    *   Includes `@supabase/auth-ui-react` (`^0.4.7`) for authentication UI.

## 7. Component Structure & Organization

*   **Source Code (`frontend/src/`)**: Well-organized with standard directories like `components/`, `pages/`, `stores/`, `lib/`, `generated/`, `assets/`, and `theme/` (seen in directory listings).
*   **Components (`frontend/src/components/`)**:
    *   Contains a mix of feature-specific components/directories (e.g., `deals/`, `pipelines/`, files like `CreateDealModal.tsx`) and common/layout directories (`common/`, `layout/`), as seen in directory listings.
*   **Drag and Drop**: `@dnd-kit/core` (`^6.3.1`) and `@dnd-kit/sortable` (`^10.0.0`) are included.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (dependencies).

## 8. Testing

*   **Test Runner**: Vitest (`^3.1.2`) is used.
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (devDependencies).
    *   Configured in `frontend/vite.config.ts` with `globals: true`, `environment: 'jsdom'`, and `setupFiles: './src/setupTests.ts'`.
*   **Testing Library**: React Testing Library (`@testing-library/react` `^16.3.0`).
    *   *Reference*: `frontend/package.json` (devDependencies).
*   **Setup**: A `frontend/src/setupTests.ts` file is present (seen in directory listings and `vite.config.ts`).

## Overall Impression

The frontend project leverages a **highly modern and well-chosen technology stack**. The specific versions and configurations (e.g., Vite setup in `vite.config.ts`, strict TypeScript in `tsconfig.app.json`, ESLint flat config in `eslint.config.js`, detailed `graphql-codegen` in `codegen.ts`) demonstrate a commitment to current best practices, developer experience, and code quality. The project structure observed in `frontend/src/` is logical and supports scalability.
