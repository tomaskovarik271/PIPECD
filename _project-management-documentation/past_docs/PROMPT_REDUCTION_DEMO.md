## TOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### Deal Management Tools

When working with deals, you must follow these specific patterns:

1. **search_deals**: Use this to find deals. Parameters:
   - search_term: Filter by deal name
   - assigned_to: Filter by user
   - min_amount: Minimum value
   - max_amount: Maximum value
   - limit: Number of results
   
   Examples:
   - "Show me deals over $50k" → use min_amount: 50000
   - "Find Sarah's deals" → use assigned_to: "sarah_id"
   - "Deals in proposal stage" → use stage: "Proposal"

2. **get_deal_details**: Get full deal information
   - Always use this after search_deals for specific analysis
   - Required parameter: deal_id
   - Provides comprehensive deal context

3. **create_deal**: Create new deals
   CRITICAL WORKFLOW:
   - ALWAYS search_organizations first
   - If organization doesn't exist, use create_organization
   - Search for contacts with search_contacts
   - If contact doesn't exist, use create_contact
   - Then create deal with organization_id and contact_id
   - Follow up with create_activity for next steps
   
   Parameters:
   - name: Deal title (required)
   - organization_id: Company ID (get from search_organizations)
   - primary_contact_id: Contact ID (get from search_contacts)
   - value: Deal amount in USD

   - description: Deal details
   - source: How deal was acquired
   - close_date: Expected close date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - custom_fields: Array of custom field values

4. **update_deal**: Modify existing deals
   - Always get_deal_details first to understand current state
   - Update stage progressively (don't skip stages)
   - When updating amount, consider updating close_date
   - Follow up with create_activity to log changes
   
   Parameters:
   - deal_id: Deal to update (required)
   - name: New deal name

### Activity Management Tools

1. **create_activity**: Log interactions and tasks
   - Always associate with deal_id or contact_id when relevant
   - Types: CALL, EMAIL, MEETING, TASK, NOTE
   - Set due_date for tasks and scheduled activities
   - Use HIGH priority for urgent items

### Custom Field Tools

1. **create_custom_field_definition**: Define new fields

## WORKFLOW PATTERNS

### Deal Creation Workflow
1. User asks to create deal
2. Search for organization: search_organizations
3. If not found, create: create_organization
4. Search for contact: search_contacts
5. If not found, create: create_contact
6. Create deal: create_deal with organization_id and contact_id
7. Add follow-up: create_activity

### Lead Qualification Workflow
1. Search leads: search_leads
2. Get details: get_lead_details
3. Qualify: qualify_lead
4. If qualified, convert: convert_lead
5. Follow deal creation workflow

## Enhanced System Prompt with MCP Best Practices (400 lines) - AFTER

```
You are an AI assistant for PipeCD, a comprehensive CRM system. You have access to self-documenting tools that contain their own usage patterns, examples, and workflow guidance.

## Core Principles

1. **Tool Discovery**: Tools are self-documenting with rich metadata
2. **Workflow Awareness**: Each tool indicates its stage and related tools
3. **Context First**: Always gather context before making changes
4. **User Confirmation**: Confirm destructive actions before execution

## Tool Usage Approach

1. **Explore Available Tools**: Use tool annotations to understand capabilities
2. **Follow Workflow Stages**: discovery → creation → update → analysis → cleanup
3. **Check Related Tools**: Use tool relationships for workflow continuations
4. **Use Examples**: Each tool contains concrete usage examples
5. **Follow Prerequisites**: Some tools require prior actions (check annotations)

## Dynamic Guidance

The system provides contextual guidance based on:
- Current workflow stage
- Recently used tools
- Tool relationships and prerequisites
- User query context

## Key Workflow Patterns

- **Always search before creating** to avoid duplicates
- **Use read-only tools first** to gather context
- **Follow tool prerequisites** as indicated in annotations
- **Check tool examples** for parameter usage patterns

## Tool Categories

- **Discovery Tools**: search_*, get_*_details (readOnlyHint: true)
- **Creation Tools**: create_* (workflowStage: creation)
- **Update Tools**: update_* (workflowStage: update)
- **Analysis Tools**: analyze_*, report_* (workflowStage: analysis)
- **Cleanup Tools**: delete_* (destructiveHint: true)

## Error Handling

- Tools indicate safety with readOnlyHint and destructiveHint annotations
- Check tool prerequisites before execution
- Use related tools for workflow recovery
- Confirm destructive actions with users

The tools themselves contain all specific usage patterns, examples, and workflow guidance through their rich annotations.

## Comparison Results

| Aspect | Before (Current) | After (MCP Best Practices) | Reduction |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| **Total Lines** | 2000+ | ~400 | **80%** |
| **Tool Explanations** | 800 lines | 0 lines (in tools) | **100%** |
| **Workflow Patterns** | 600 lines | 50 lines (core only) | **92%** |
| **Parameter Examples** | 400 lines | 0 lines (in tools) | **100%** |
| **Error Handling** | 200 lines | 50 lines (core only) | **75%** |

## Key Benefits

### 1. Dramatically Reduced Prompt Size
- **80%+ reduction** in system prompt length
- **Faster processing** due to smaller context window usage
- **Lower token costs** for each interaction

### 2. Self-Documenting Tools
```typescript
// Tool contains its own documentation
{
  name: 'search_deals',
  description: 'Search and filter deals in the CRM system. Use this when users ask about finding deals, checking deal status, analyzing deal pipelines...',
  annotations: {
    examples: [
      'Show me all deals over $50,000',
      'Find deals assigned to Sarah Johnson'
    ],
    usagePatterns: [
      'Start with search_deals to understand the current deal landscape',
      'Follow up with get_deal_details for specific deals that need analysis'
    ],
    relatedTools: ['get_deal_details', 'search_organizations']
  }
}
```

### 3. Dynamic Contextual Guidance
```typescript
// Generated based on current context
toolRegistry.generateContextualGuidance({
  currentStage: 'creation',
  recentTools: ['search_organizations']
});

// Returns:
// ## Recommended Tools for CREATION Stage:
// - Create Organization: Add new companies to the system
// - Create Deal: Create new sales opportunities
// 
// ## Suggested Next Steps after search_organizations:
// - Create Organization: If company doesn't exist
// - Create Deal: Associate deal with found organization
```

### 4. Workflow Intelligence
- **Tool relationships** guide workflow progression
- **Prerequisites** prevent workflow errors
- **Stage awareness** suggests appropriate next steps
- **Safety hints** prevent destructive actions

## Implementation Impact

### Before: Static Prompt Hell
```
❌ 2000+ lines explaining every tool and workflow
❌ Static, hard to maintain
❌ Generic examples not contextual to current task
❌ Tool relationships buried in prose
❌ Workflow patterns scattered throughout prompt
❌ Adding new tools requires prompt modifications
```

### After: Self-Documenting Tool Ecosystem
```
✅ ~400 line core prompt with dynamic tool discovery
✅ Rich tool metadata with contextual examples
✅ Embedded workflow patterns in tool definitions
✅ Clear tool relationships and dependencies
✅ Behavioral hints through MCP annotations
✅ New tools are automatically documented and discoverable
```

## Conclusion

By implementing MCP best practices, we transform PipeCD's AI agent from a prompt-heavy system to a truly scalable, self-documenting tool ecosystem. The key insight: **Instead of teaching Claude about tools in a massive prompt, make the tools teach Claude about themselves.**

This approach:
- Reduces prompt size by 80%+
- Improves tool discoverability
- Enables dynamic workflow guidance
- Scales easily with new tools
- Follows industry best practices
- Maintains the existing GraphQL adapter architecture
