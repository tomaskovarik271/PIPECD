User display names are now integrated into the Deal History/Audit Trail, providing clearer attribution for actions.
*   **Technology Stack & Architecture:**
    *   Successfully implemented a **React-based Single Page Application (SPA)** using Vite for a fast and modern frontend experience.
    *   Deployed a **GraphQL API** using GraphQL Yoga on Netlify Functions, providing a flexible and efficient data access layer.
    *   Utilized **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** for the database, benefiting from its integrated authentication, Row-Level Security (RLS), and real-time features.
    *   Established a **backend service layer** in TypeScript (`/lib` directory) to encapsulate business logic, promoting modularity and testability.
    *   Integrated **Inngest** for managing asynchronous background tasks, such as logging events upon entity creation.
    *   Implemented a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system at the database level, ensuring granular control over data access.
*   **User Interface & Experience:**
    *   Developed a clean and functional user interface using the **Chakra UI** component library.
    *   Implemented client-side state management with **Zustand** for a responsive user experience.
    *   Integrated **Supabase Auth** for secure user authentication, including GitHub as an OAuth provider.

## 4. Technical Architecture

The system employs a modern, serverless architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework/Library:** React with Vite.
    *   **UI Components:** Chakra UI.
    *   **State Management:** Zustand.
    *   **GraphQL Client:** `graphql-request`.
    *   **Build & Deployment:** Hosted on Netlify, built via Vite.
*   **Backend (API):**
    *   **Platform:** Netlify Functions.
    *   **API Type:** GraphQL (using GraphQL Yoga).
    *   **Language:** TypeScript.
    *   **Schema & Resolvers:** Defined in `netlify/functions/graphql/`, with business logic abstracted to service layers in `/lib`.
*   **Database & Persistence:**
    *   **Platform:** Supabase (PostgreSQL).
    *   **Schema Management:** SQL migrations managed by Supabase CLI.
    *   **Key Features Used:** RLS, Auth, Database functions, Realtime (available).
*   **Authentication:**
    *   Provided by Supabase Auth (JWT-based).
    *   Supports email/password and OAuth providers (e.g., GitHub).
*   **Asynchronous Tasks:**
    *   Managed by Inngest, integrated with Netlify Functions.
*   **Shared Logic:**
    *   A common `/lib` directory contains TypeScript modules for backend services, database clients, and shared utilities, ensuring code reusability and separation of concerns.

## 5. Security & Data Integrity

Security and data integrity are core considerations within Project PipeCD:

*   **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Supabase RLS is implemented extensively across all primary data tables. This ensures that users can only access or modify data they are permitted to, based on their identity and role.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A comprehensive RBAC system is built into the database schema. This system defines roles (e.g., `admin`, `member`) and granular permissions (e.g., `deal:create`, `person:read_any`). SQL helper functions enforce these permissions within RLS policies and provide user permission details to the application layer.
*   **Authentication:** Secure authentication is handled by Supabase Auth, utilizing JWTs.
*   **Input Validation:** Zod, a TypeScript-first schema validation library, is used in the GraphQL API layer to validate incoming data for mutations, preventing invalid data from reaching the service layer or database.
*   **Service Layer Abstraction:** Business logic is encapsulated within service layers, providing a controlled interface for data manipulation and reducing the risk of direct, unvalidated database operations from resolvers.

## 6. Development Practices & Quality

The project adheres to several best practices to ensure code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity:

*   **TypeScript:** Used throughout the entire stack (frontend, backend, shared libraries) for strong typing, improved code clarity, and early error detection.
*   **ESLint:** Configured for code linting to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.
*   **GraphQL Code Generation:** `@graphql-codegen` is used to automatically generate TypeScript types from the GraphQL schema for both frontend and backend, ensuring type safety across the API boundary.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation between frontend, backend API, shared service logic, and database concerns. Resolvers are kept lean by delegating business logic to service layers.
*   **Configuration Management:** Environment-specific configurations are managed via `.env` files for local development and Netlify environment variables for deployed environments.
*   **Version Control:** Git is used for version control, with development following feature-branching workflows (as outlined in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE_V2.md`).
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Unit/Integration Tests (Vitest):** Backend services in the `/lib` directory have a good foundation of unit tests. Frontend store logic is also a target for Vitest.
    *   **End-to-End Tests (Playwright):** Basic E2E tests for authentication and core CRUD flows are in place.
    *   While a testing framework is established, expanding coverage across all areas (resolvers, frontend components, more E2E scenarios) is a recognized area for ongoing improvement.

## 7. Areas for Future Focus / Next Steps

To further enhance Project PipeCD and maximize its value, the following areas are recommended for focus:

*   **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
    *   Expand unit and integration tests for GraphQL resolvers.
    *   Increase test coverage for frontend components and Zustand store slices.
    *   Develop more extensive E2E test scenarios for all core features and RBAC policies.
*   **CI/CD Automation:**
    *   Implement GitHub Actions (or similar) for continuous integration (running linters, tests) and continuous deployment to staging/production environments on Netlify.
*   **RBAC Enhancements & User Management:**
    *   Develop UI for managing user roles and permissions (if required beyond initial seeding).
    *   Refine and test RBAC policies for complex scenarios and edge cases.
*   **Advanced Feature Development:**
    *   Prioritize and implement features from `PROJECT_ROADMAP_V2.md`, such as advanced reporting, custom fields, workflow automation, and third-party integrations.
